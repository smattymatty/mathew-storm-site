<p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong> Create warrantless surveillance powers → Share the collected data internationally → Call it "border security" → Expand the powers and repeat.</p>

<p>Try reading <a href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/pl/charter-charte/c2_2.html">The Bill</a>, it's so bloated with bullshit that you need a law degree and three cups of coffee just to figure out they're asking for permission to read your emails.</p>
<h2 id="i-the-perfect-recursive-loop">I. The Perfect Recursive Loop</h2>
<p>Start with Part 14, because it's the most honest about what this bill actually does.</p>
<p>"Timely Access to Data and Information" - that's the section title. Not "border security." Not "national defense." Just: we want your data, and we want it now.</p>
<p>Part 14 creates "information demands" - a new power that lets officers compel service providers to confirm if you have an account and provide "general information about the nature of services." No warrant required. Just "reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has or will be committed."</p>
<p>Notice the language: "has or will be." Past or future. Actual crimes or theoretical ones. The net is deliberately wide.</p>
<h3 id="the-justification-machine">The Justification Machine</h3>
<p>Here's where the recursion kicks in. The government justifies this warrantless access by pointing to existing legal frameworks - mutual assistance treaties, information sharing agreements, international cooperation protocols. We need these powers, they argue, to fulfill obligations we've already made.</p>
<p>Those obligations? They were justified by previous legislation that created the need for better information sharing. Which was justified by security concerns that required expanded international cooperation. Which created new obligations that require new powers to fulfill.</p>
<p>Each law creates the justification for the next law. Each power demands expanded powers to be effective. Each "cooperation" agreement necessitates deeper "cooperation" to function properly.</p>
<h3 id="the-self-replicating-law">The Self-Replicating Law</h3>
<p>The system has learned to reproduce itself. Part 14 doesn't just collect data - it creates the legal infrastructure that will demand Part 15, Part 16, Part 17. The "Timely Access to Data and Information" act will generate delays and gaps that require a "Comprehensive Access to All Information" act to address.</p>
<p>Section 487.014 allows judges to authorize "examination of computer data" with provisions that "the judge would have discretion as to what information is specified in it." Translation: we'll figure out what we want to search for after we start searching.</p>
<p>This is legislation designed to expand itself. Each search will reveal the need for broader searches. Each data demand will justify more comprehensive data demands. Each international sharing agreement will demonstrate why deeper cooperation is necessary.</p>
<p>The bill contains its own growth mechanism. It's surveillance law with built-in sequels.</p>
<h2 id="ii-fifteen-ways-to-surrender-what-youre-protecting">II. Fifteen Ways to Surrender What You're Protecting</h2>
<p>Fifteen parts. Not all are equally invasive - Parts 1-4 deal with customs facilities, drug scheduling, and postal law. But the surveillance architecture runs throughout, and three parts stand out as particularly brazen examples of sovereignty theatre.</p>
<h3 id="part-6-the-immigration-data-fire-sale">Part 6: The Immigration Data Fire Sale</h3>
<p>Part 6 authorizes the Minister of Immigration to "disclose any personal information under the control of the Department of Immigration" to other federal departments, provincial governments, or crown corporations "for the purposes of administering or enforcing any federal or provincial laws."</p>
<p>Read that again. ANY personal information. For ANY law enforcement purpose. To ANY level of government.</p>
<p>The Charter analysis dismisses this with bureaucratic sleight of hand: "Disclosure outside of the Department would be subject to a written agreement or arrangement." As if signing a piece of paper transforms mass data sharing into privacy protection.</p>
<p>Here's the kicker: the bill explicitly prohibits provincial governments from sharing this data with "foreign entities" without written consent from the Immigration Minister (Section 5.5(2)). But notice what's missing? Any parallel restriction on federal sharing with foreign entities. The bill restricts provinces but is silent on federal international sharing - which would operate under other existing authorities. This creates asymmetric control: provinces need permission, while federal sharing continues under whatever frameworks already exist.</p>
<h3 id="part-10-the-money-laundering-theatre">Part 10: The Money Laundering Theatre</h3>
<p>Part 10 amends the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act to increase penalties from $2 million to $20 million while expanding what counts as a "compliance order violation." The government frames this as cracking down on financial crime. The reality? It's creating a data dragnet that captures legitimate financial privacy under the guise of fighting money laundering.</p>
<p>Here's the sleight of hand: Section 11.71 allows financial institutions to collect personal information "without the individual's knowledge or consent" - but only when law enforcement provides it with written affirmation that disclosure is for "detecting or deterring money laundering." The catch? Section 55(3)(f.2) then allows FINTRAC to share that same information with the Commissioner of Canada Elections if there are "reasonable grounds to suspect" it's relevant to election law violations.</p>
<p>Your banking data, collected for money laundering investigations, can become election investigation data. The bill creates a potential pipeline from financial surveillance to political investigations - all it takes is "suspicion" of election law violations to transform anti-money laundering data into election enforcement intelligence.</p>
<p>Most insidious: Section 11.72 prohibits using this information "with the intent to prejudice a criminal investigation." Sounds protective, right? Except it explicitly allows use for "detecting or deterring a contravention of the laws of Canada." So they can't use your banking data to interfere with an investigation, but they can use it to start one. The protection is actually permission.</p>
<h3 id="part-15-the-mandatory-backdoor-framework">Part 15: The Mandatory Backdoor Framework</h3>
<p>Part 15 creates the "Supporting Authorized Access to Information Act" - a framework forcing "Electronic Service Providers" to build "lawful access capabilities" that can be triggered by court orders from any jurisdiction with mutual legal assistance agreements.</p>
<p>This is the mandatory backdoor bill that privacy advocates have warned about for years, disguised as administrative regulation. The government can issue "ministerial orders" requiring companies to develop specific surveillance capabilities, then prohibit them from disclosing the existence of those orders.</p>
<p>The Charter analysis treats this as a minor regulatory burden: "Privacy interests are diminished in the regulatory and administrative contexts." But requiring companies to build surveillance infrastructure that foreign governments can access through existing treaties isn't regulation - it's architecting surrender.</p>
<p>The bill even includes a gag order: companies face fines up to $250,000 for disclosing information about ministerial orders. Build the backdoors, stay quiet about it, and trust that international partners will only use these capabilities for legitimate purposes.</p>
<p>These three parts reveal the bill's true architecture: collect everything (Part 6), normalize international sharing (Part 13), then mandate the technical infrastructure to make it seamless (Part 15). Border security becomes the justification for building a comprehensive data-sharing apparatus with foreign governments.</p>
<p>The borders aren't getting stronger. The surveillance infrastructure is. And that infrastructure has export capabilities built right in.</p>
<h2 id="iii-the-language-that-hides-the-reality">III. The Language That Hides the Reality</h2>
<p>Bill C-2 speaks fluent bureaucrat - that special dialect where surveillance becomes "information sharing," backdoors become "lawful access capabilities," and mass data collection becomes "administrative cooperation."</p>
<h3 id="the-sanitization-engine">The Sanitization Engine</h3>
<p>Section 487.0121 creates "information demands" with only "reasonable grounds to suspect" rather than "reasonable grounds to believe." The bar isn't just lowered; it's buried underground. The Charter analysis claims this "would not alter the existing legal framework" - right, it just adds 15 new ways to bypass it.</p>
<p>Let's translate some key phrases:</p>
<p><strong>Bill C-2 says:</strong> "The Minister may share information with federal and provincial partners for law enforcement purposes."<br />
<strong>Reality:</strong> We're building a data pipeline where your immigration records become police intelligence without a warrant.</p>
<p><strong>Bill C-2 says:</strong> "Electronic service providers must develop lawful access capabilities."<br />
<strong>Reality:</strong> Tech companies must build backdoors that any treaty partner can walk through.</p>
<p><strong>Bill C-2 says:</strong> "Information demands require reasonable grounds to suspect."<br />
<strong>Reality:</strong> We can fish for data based on hunches, not evidence.</p>
<p>This is exactly what <a href="/blog/Governance/fuck-the-facade/">"Fuck the Facade"</a> warns about: sanitized institutional language that obscures the actual human impact. When the government says "administrative cooperation," they mean reading your emails. When they say "information sharing partnerships," they mean foreign governments accessing Canadian data without warrants.</p>
<h3 id="the-recursive-justification-machine">The Recursive Justification Machine</h3>
<p>Here's where the bureaucratic language creates its own momentum. Each section references other sections, each power justified by previous powers, each violation normalized by the language of the previous violation.</p>
<p>Part 14 justifies warrantless access by citing "existing legal frameworks." Those frameworks? Created by previous bills using the same circular logic. Part 15 mandates backdoors to fulfill "international obligations." Those obligations? Created by treaties justified by the need for backdoors.</p>
<p>It's <a href="/philo/the-recursive-absurd/">The Recursive Absurd</a> in legislative form: the system justifying itself through self-reference, using its own existence as proof of its necessity.</p>
<h2 id="iv-when-systems-optimize-against-their-stated-purpose">IV. When Systems Optimize Against Their Stated Purpose</h2>
<p>Bill C-2 claims to strengthen borders. Let's count the ways it actually weakens them:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data Sovereignty Surrender</strong>: Mandates sharing Canadian data with foreign governments</li>
<li><strong>Technical Vulnerability Requirements</strong>: Forces companies to build backdoors that any competent adversary can exploit</li>
<li><strong>Jurisdictional Confusion</strong>: Creates 15 different pathways for data collection with different oversight mechanisms</li>
<li><strong>Security Theater</strong>: Performs border protection while actually creating security holes</li>
</ol>
<p>This is legislative techno-absurdism at its finest. The bill optimizes for surveillance metrics (data collected, searches conducted, "partnerships" established) while degrading actual security (more attack surfaces, more data exposure, more systemic vulnerabilities).</p>
<h3 id="the-metrics-that-matter-vs-the-metrics-we-measure">The Metrics That Matter vs The Metrics We Measure</h3>
<p>The bill meticulously tracks compliance metrics - violation reports, information changes, penalty statistics. But nowhere in 300 pages does it measure what matters: How much Canadian data flows to foreign governments. How many backdoors get exploited. Whether anyone is actually safer.</p>
<p>This is Graeber's "iron law of liberalism" - measuring everything except what matters. We'll have detailed statistics on properly processed "information demands" but no tracking of whether those demands made anyone safer or just fed foreign surveillance systems.</p>
<h3 id="the-techno-absurdist-policy-pattern">The Techno-Absurdist Policy Pattern</h3>
<p>Watch how Bill C-2 builds its own necessity through recursive justification:</p>
<p>Section 487.0181 authorizes requests to "foreign entities" for telecommunications data because we have "international agreements." But flip to Part 15 - the "Supporting Authorized Access to Information Act" - and you find we're mandating Canadian companies build infrastructure specifically so foreign entities can access it through those same agreements. We're creating the vulnerability to fulfill the obligation that justifies creating the vulnerability.</p>
<p>Part 6 lets Immigration share data with any government department for "law enforcement purposes." Part 10 expands money laundering provisions to capture more data. Part 13 expands sex offender registries to include vehicle data. Each expansion creates data that other parts can access, which justifies further expansion to "close gaps" in the system. The bill doesn't just authorize surveillance - it architectures its own growth.</p>
<p>The masterstroke is Section 87.301, which allows the government to specify that certain applications "are not to be accepted for processing" if it's "in the public interest." They can literally shut down privacy-protecting services while mandating surveillance-enabling ones. The system doesn't just expand - it eliminates alternatives to itself.</p>
<p>This is the recursive absurd in statutory form: each provision creates the conditions that justify the next provision. The bill generates the very insecurity it claims to address, then uses that insecurity to justify further powers.</p>
<p>This is exactly what happens when we abandon authentic language for corporate speak. Instead of saying "we want to spy on Canadians and share the data with foreign governments," they wrap it in 300 pages of bureaucratic language about "border security" and "administrative cooperation."</p>
<p>If they had to use honest language - "The Mandatory Backdoor and Foreign Surveillance Enablement Act" - the absurdity would be obvious. But wrapped in sanitized institutional language, it sounds reasonable. Professional. Necessary.</p>
<h2 id="vi-breaking-the-loop-or-accepting-we-cant">VI. Breaking the Loop (Or Accepting We Can't)</h2>
<p>Here's the uncomfortable truth that no politician will admit: once this infrastructure exists, it will be used for purposes beyond its original intent. Always. Every single time.</p>
<p>The "temporary" powers become permanent. The "limited" sharing becomes unlimited. The "specific" purposes become general. The system optimizes for its own expansion while using the language of the values it's undermining.</p>
<h3 id="what-real-opposition-would-look-like">What Real Opposition Would Look Like</h3>
<p>Real opposition would say: "This is surveillance infrastructure disguised as border security. Foreign governments will have warrantless access to Canadian data. Tech companies will be forced to build backdoors that criminals will exploit. Absolutely fucking not."</p>
<p>But instead we get the theatrical performance: Opposition MPs expressing "concerns" while negotiating minor amendments. Companies complying while issuing partnership statements. Everyone pretending their role matters while the surveillance apparatus gets built.</p>
<h3 id="the-only-honest-response">The Only Honest Response</h3>
<p>The honest response our political system can't produce: "This is authoritarian surveillance infrastructure that will be abused and represents a fundamental betrayal of sovereignty."</p>
<p>But honesty doesn't survive committee. So we get 300 pages of bureaucratic language building surveillance while claiming protection. Data sharing disguised as cooperation. Mandatory backdoors called "lawful access capabilities."</p>
<p>We get the recursive absurd: a system that protects borders by eliminating them, ensures security by mandating vulnerabilities, and preserves sovereignty by surrendering it.</p>
<p>The facade says "Strong Borders Act."<br />
The reality says "Fuck your privacy, we're building the surveillance state."</p>
<p>At least be honest about it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Bill C-2 is what happens when techno-absurdism becomes law. It's a system optimizing against its stated purpose, using the language of security to justify insecurity, the language of sovereignty to justify surrender.</p>
<p>Every Canadian should read this bill - not the government's summary, not the media's interpretation, but the actual text. See how surveillance gets wrapped in bureaucracy. Watch how "administrative cooperation" means your data in foreign databases. Observe how "lawful access" means mandated vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>This is <a href="/philo/the-recursive-absurd/">The Recursive Absurd</a> in legislative form: building systems that create the problems they claim to solve, then using those problems to justify expansion.</p>
<p>The language hides the reality.<br />
The metrics obscure the impact.<br />
The facade protects the system.</p>
<p>But once you see it - once you translate the bureaucratese back into human language - you can't unsee it.</p>
<p>Bill C-2 isn't protecting our borders. It's building the infrastructure for their dissolution. One information demand, one data share, one mandated backdoor at a time.</p>
