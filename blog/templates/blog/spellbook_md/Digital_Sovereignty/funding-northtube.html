<h1 id="funding-northtube-building-something-sustainable">Funding NorthTube: Building Something Sustainable</h1>
<p>I launched <a href="https://northtube.ca">NorthTube</a> yesterday - an ad-free PeerTube instance for Canadian creators, educators, and people focused on public good content. The technical side was challenging but manageable. The funding side? That's the real puzzle.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Video hosting is expensive. Even with a lean setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>VPS hosting: ~$20/month (bare minimum)</li>
<li>Storage &amp; bandwidth (growing): ~$10-20/month</li>
<li>Domain, SSL, misc: ~$5/month</li>
</ul>
<p>That's <strong>~$40/month minimum</strong>. Not breaking the bank, but not sustainable long-term if I'm paying out of pocket, especially as usage grows.</p>
<p>More importantly: if this is truly community-owned, the community should fund it. Otherwise it's just <em>my</em> project that happens to be open to others.</p>
<h2 id="how-were-funding-northtube-right-now">How We're Funding NorthTube Right Now</h2>
<p>NorthTube is currently funded through <strong>community donations</strong> via <a href="https://opencollective.com/northtube">Open Collective</a>. No ads, no data selling, no corporate sponsors - just people who believe in ethical media.</p>
<p>We're building toward a 6-month reserve (~$240 for bare minimum hosting) plus buffer for moderators, creator support, and infrastructure = <strong>$1,000 CAD total</strong>.</p>
<p>All finances are 100% transparent on Open Collective - you can see every dollar.</p>
<p><a href="https://opencollective.com/northtube">Become a supporter â†’</a></p>
<h2 id="what-im-planning-membership-tiers">What I'm Planning: Membership Tiers</h2>
<p>Once we hit sustainability, I want to implement something different. Here's what I'm thinking:</p>
<h3 id="friend-of-northtube-5month">Friend of NorthTube - $5/month</h3>
<ul>
<li>5GB storage quota (vs 1GB free)</li>
<li>Listed as supporter (optional)</li>
<li>Behind-the-scenes updates</li>
<li>Community pride</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty standard. Entry-level support.</p>
<h3 id="creator-supporter-15month">Creator Supporter - $15/month</h3>
<p>Here's where it gets interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>20GB storage quota</li>
<li>Early access to features</li>
<li>Vote on community decisions</li>
<li><strong>Choose one NorthTube creator to support directly ($5/month goes to them)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>That last point is the experiment. When you become a Creator Supporter, $5 of your monthly contribution goes directly to a creator you choose (not yourself). The other $10 goes to platform sustainment.</p>
<h3 id="community-champion-50month">Community Champion - $50/month</h3>
<ul>
<li>100GB storage quota</li>
<li>Support <strong>three creators</strong> ($15/month split between them)</li>
<li>Custom channel badge</li>
<li>Your name in platform credits</li>
<li>Priority support</li>
<li>Input on roadmap</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="institutional-partner-200month">Institutional Partner - $200/month</h3>
<ul>
<li>For schools, libraries, nonprofits</li>
<li>250GB+ storage quota</li>
<li>Dedicated support</li>
<li>Custom branding</li>
<li>Priority features</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-the-creator-support-feature">Why the Creator Support Feature?</h2>
<p>Most platforms treat creator monetization and platform funding as separate problems. You fund the platform through one system, creators through another (Patreon, Ko-fi, etc.).</p>
<p>What if they were connected?</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Builds community</strong> - Members have a direct relationship with creators<br />
2. <strong>Distributes wealth</strong> - Platform success flows to creators immediately<br />
3. <strong>Incentivizes quality</strong> - Creators want to make content worth supporting<br />
4. <strong>Novel differentiation</strong> - I don't know of other PeerTube instances doing this</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
1. <strong>Administrative complexity</strong> - Tracking who's supporting whom, monthly payouts<br />
2. <strong>Eligibility rules</strong> - Who can receive support? (3+ videos? Good standing?)<br />
3. <strong>What if creator leaves?</strong> - Supporter picks someone else<br />
4. <strong>Tax implications?</strong> - I'm not a lawyer or accountant</p>
<h2 id="the-math">The Math</h2>
<p>Let's say we get to <strong>100 members</strong> with a typical distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 Friends @ $5 = $250/month</li>
<li>35 Creator Supporters @ $15 = $525/month ($175 to creators, $350 to platform)</li>
<li>12 Champions @ $50 = $600/month ($180 to creators, $420 to platform)</li>
<li>3 Institutions @ $200 = $600/month</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total: $1,975/month</strong><br />
- <strong>Platform gets: $1,620/month</strong> (covers $40/month hosting + moderators + reserves)<br />
- <strong>Creators get: $355/month</strong> (distributed among supported creators)</p>
<p>At 100 members, we're not just sustainable - we can pay moderators fairly, support creators, and build reserves for growth.</p>
<p>Even at just <strong>10 Friends</strong> ($50/month), we cover base hosting costs and prove the model works.</p>
<h2 id="what-im-unsure-about">What I'm Unsure About</h2>
<p><strong>Transparency:</strong><br />
Do I publish exactly who's supporting whom? Anonymous? Opt-in?</p>
<p><strong>Payout mechanics:</strong><br />
PayPal? Interac? Monthly? Quarterly? Minimum threshold?</p>
<p><strong>Creator eligibility:</strong><br />
Must opt-in? Minimum content requirements? What about new creators?</p>
<p><strong>Tax handling:</strong><br />
Is NorthTube a payment processor here? Do creators get 1099s/T4As? (I really need to talk to an accountant.)</p>
<p><strong>Scaling:</strong><br />
At 10 creators this is manageable. At 100? Need automation.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-models-i-considered">Alternative Models I Considered</h2>
<p><strong>Patreon-style per-creator:</strong><br />
Each creator sets up their own funding. Platform takes a cut.<br />
<em>Problem:</em> Splits the community, adds friction.</p>
<p><strong>Co-op incorporation:</strong><br />
Formal democratic governance, member-owners.<br />
<em>Maybe later:</em> Too complex for day one, but interesting long-term.</p>
<p><strong>Grants/sponsorships:</strong><br />
Apply for public good tech funding.<br />
<em>Exploring:</em> But can't rely on this as primary funding.</p>
<p><strong>Just keep it simple:</strong><br />
Regular membership tiers, no creator support feature.<br />
<em>Boring:</em> But maybe that's smarter?</p>
<h2 id="what-im-not-doing">What I'm NOT Doing</h2>
<p><strong>Not running ads</strong> - That's the whole point.</p>
<p><strong>Not selling data</strong> - Your privacy isn't for sale.</p>
<p><strong>Not seeking VC funding</strong> - The moment you take investor money, you serve investors, not users.</p>
<p><strong>Not making it complicated</strong> - No NFTs, no tokens, no blockchain nonsense. Just transparent community funding.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-next">What Happens Next</h2>
<p>I'm starting with the <strong>Bootstrap to Sustainability</strong> goal on <a href="https://opencollective.com/northtube">Open Collective</a>: <strong>$1,000 CAD</strong>. This gives us 6 months of hosting if we upgrade to $150/month, proves people actually care about this, and gives us runway to figure out what comes next.</p>
<p>Once we hit that milestone, I'll implement the membership tiers. The creator support feature might launch as a beta - test it with a small group first, work out the kinks.</p>
<p>If it's too complicated or doesn't work well? We simplify. The goal is sustainability, not novelty for its own sake.</p>
<h2 id="your-thoughts">Your Thoughts?</h2>
<p>If you're reading this and have experience with:<br />
- Community platform funding<br />
- Creator monetization systems<br />
- Co-op governance<br />
- Canadian tax law for platforms (please help)</p>
