            <p>Corporate language isn't just boring—it's a technology of control. When governance documents use "we'll consider strategic options" instead of "lol absolutely fucking not," they obscure reality, prevent accountability, and exclude the humans they claim to serve.</p>
<p>This essay examines how sanitized institutional language systematically maintains power structures while authentic language—even crude, profane language—threatens those structures by naming uncomfortable truths. Drawing on Orwell's analysis of political euphemism, Graeber's theory of bullshit jobs, and Le Guin's critique of hero narratives, I argue that <strong>profanity in governance documents isn't unprofessional; it's anti-bullshit.</strong></p>
<p>When open source communities adopt corporate speak, they lose touch with their founding purpose. When they preserve authentic human language—including deliberate crudeness—they maintain the friction necessary for real democracy.</p>
<p>The choice is stark: facades that protect power, or fuck-the-facade honesty that preserves human agency.</p>

            <p>The sanitized professional language of institutions, characterized by euphemism, abstraction, and deliberate vagueness. "Leveraging synergies," "optimizing stakeholder value," "right-sizing operations."</p>
<p>Corporate speak operates through what Orwell called "operators and verbal false limbs"—phrases that replace simple verbs with complex constructions. Instead of "decide," we "make a determination." Instead of "fire," we "implement workforce adjustments."</p>
<p>The function isn't communication but obfuscation. Corporate speak makes the unacceptable sound reasonable ("collateral damage"), the meaningless sound important ("driving engagement"), and the simple sound complex ("utilize" instead of "use").</p>
<p>Key characteristic: You can read entire paragraphs without forming a mental picture of what's actually happening. That's not a bug—it's the core feature.</p>

            <p>Direct human speech that names things as they are, including emotional responses, crude reactions, and uncomfortable truths. "This is fucked," "I don't understand this," "We're lying to ourselves."</p>
<p>Authentic language preserves what corporate speak erases: accountability ("I fucked up" vs "mistakes were made"), emotion ("this pisses me off" vs "concerns have been raised"), and clarity ("you're fired" vs "your position has been made redundant").</p>
<p>Includes profanity not as performance but as precision—sometimes "bullshit" is the only accurate term. Includes admission of ignorance, expressions of frustration, and rejection of false positivity.</p>

<h2 id="i-the-distance-between-strategic-options-and-absolutely-fucking-not">I. The Distance Between "Strategic Options" and "Absolutely Fucking Not"</h2>
<p>Picture two responses to a tech giant's acquisition offer for your open source project:</p>
<p><strong>Response A:</strong> "The governance committee will evaluate all strategic options to maximize stakeholder value while maintaining alignment with our core mission and values framework. We appreciate this opportunity for dialogue and will conduct appropriate due diligence to assess synergies and potential optimization of resource allocation."</p>
<p><strong>Response B:</strong> "lol absolutely fucking not."</p>
<p>Which response tells you what's actually happening? Which one could you explain to your grandmother? Which one makes the community's position crystal clear to everyone—members, media, and the acquiring company?</p>
<p>Orwell warned us about this gap in 1946. "The great enemy of clear language is insincerity," he wrote in "Politics and the English Language." When there's distance between real and declared aims, we instinctively reach for what he called "worn-out metaphors" and "pretentious diction." </p>
<p>The corporate response above uses 42 words to say nothing. It could mean yes, no, or maybe. It commits to nothing while sounding thoughtful. It protects the speakers from accountability—if they later accept the acquisition, they never said no. If they reject it, they were just "evaluating options."</p>
<p>The authentic response uses three words (four if you count "lol") to communicate everything: the offer is absurd, we're not even considering it, and we find the very suggestion laughable. No accountability shield. No escape hatch. No plausible deniability.</p>

            <p>In "Politics and the English Language," Orwell provides devastating examples of how euphemism transforms atrocity into bureaucracy. "Defenceless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called pacification."</p>
<p>He identified specific mechanisms of corruption: dying metaphors ("toe the line"), operators that avoid simple verbs ("render inoperative" instead of "break"), pretentious diction using Greek/Latin roots to elevate simple statements, and meaningless words that have "several different meanings which cannot be reconciled."</p>
<p>His most damning observation: "Political language—and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists—is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind."</p>
<p>The translation exercise proves his point. Ecclesiastes in plain English: "I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift" (49 words). In modern bureaucratese: "Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity" (38 unnecessary syllables of Latin abstraction).</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>This distance between language and meaning isn't accidental. It's architecture. When every statement requires translation, when every commitment comes wrapped in conditions, when every decision hides behind process—that's not communication failing. That's communication succeeding at its actual purpose: preventing communication.</p>
<p>In open source communities, this infection spreads through governance documents that read like corporate bylaws. "The committee shall evaluate proposals based on alignment with strategic objectives" instead of "we vote on whether it helps users." "Resources will be allocated to maximize impact" instead of "we fund what the community needs."</p>
<p>Each translation adds distance. Each euphemism reduces friction. Each abstraction makes it harder to object, because what exactly are you objecting to? Try arguing against "optimizing stakeholder value." Now try arguing against "this fucks over contributors." The second one you can actually debate.</p>
<p>The facade protects those in power by making criticism require a decoder ring. When governance documents say "adjustments to contributor expectations may be necessary," contributors don't realize they're about to get screwed until it's too late. When they say "we're cutting contributor benefits because we overspent on executive travel," everyone knows exactly what's happening and can respond accordingly.</p>
<p>Authentic language in governance isn't about being edgy or rebellious. It's about preserving the feedback loops democracy requires. When people understand what's actually being decided, they can participate. When everything's wrapped in corporate speak, only those fluent in bullshit can play.</p>
