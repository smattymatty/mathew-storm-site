## **üéØ Overall Goal**

*Concisely describe the main objective of this feature. What will users be able to do once this is implemented? What's the big win?*
*(Example: To provide users with a robust way to manage their academic courses, including enrollment, content viewing, and assignment tracking.)*

## **ü§î Current Situation / Problem Addressed**

*Why is this feature needed? What problem does it solve for EduLite users or the project itself? Is there a gap in current functionality?*
*(Example: Currently, EduLite users cannot formally enroll in courses or access structured course materials. This feature addresses that core need for a learning platform.)*

## **üß© Key Components / Scope (High-Level)**

*Break down the feature into its major functional parts or modules. This isn't the place for tiny tasks, but rather the big building blocks. Think of these as potential areas that will have their own sets of detailed sub-tasks.*
*(Example:*
* *Course Creation & Management (Admin/Teacher view)*
* *Course Discovery & Enrollment (Student view)*
* *Course Content Module (Lectures, Files, Assignments)*
* *API Endpoints for all course-related actions*
* *Basic UI/UX for interacting with courses)*

## **‚ú® Benefits / How This Feature Helps EduLite**

*What are the primary benefits of implementing this feature? How does it align with EduLite's vision?*
*(Example:*
* *Enables structured learning paths for students.*
* *Provides tools for educators to organize and deliver content.*
* *Moves EduLite closer to being a comprehensive educational tool.*
* *Increases user engagement and platform utility.)*

## **‚úÖ Success Criteria / Definition of Done (for the Entire Epic)**

*How will we know when this entire epic feature is successfully completed and meets the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) requirements? Be specific if possible.*
*(Example:*
* *Teachers can create courses with basic content (e.g., text, uploaded files).*
* *Students can view available courses and enroll in them.*
* *Enrolled students can access the content of their courses.*
* *Basic API endpoints for these actions are functional and tested.*
* *Frontend has a basic interface for these interactions.)*

## **üîó Sub-Tasks / Related Issues**

*(This section should be manually updated in the created issue to link to specific task issues as they are defined. Each sub-task should be its own GitHub Issue.)*

* `[Task Category 1]: [Specific Task 1.1 Name]` (#IssueNumber)
* `[Task Category 1]: [Specific Task 1.2 Name]` (#IssueNumber)
* `[Task Category 2]: [Specific Task 2.1 Name]` (#IssueNumber)
* *(Add more as they are defined...)*

## **üí° Additional Context (Optional)**

*Include any other relevant information, such as:*
* *Links to related discussions on Discord or GitHub Discussions.*
* *Links to design documents, wireframes, or mockups (if any).*
* *Specific technical considerations or constraints.*
* *Any dependencies on other features or tasks.*
*(Example: Initial design ideas were discussed in Discord channel #feature-xyz on [Date].)*

## **üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Considerations (Optional)**

*Are there any specific technologies that will be used or impacted by this feature? Any new libraries or significant changes to the existing stack?*
*(Example: This feature will heavily utilize Django models, DRF for APIs, and React components on the frontend. No new major dependencies are anticipated for the MVP.)*

*This is a significant feature, and your contribution to any part of it is highly valued! Let's build something great together!*
