# Chapter 15 - The Silence

The workshop had been quiet for three days, and that was wrong.

Not the workshop itself, Sisyphus and Daedalus worked in their usual rhythm, stylus scratching papyrus, tools clicking against instruments.

No, the wrongness came from below.

The labyrinth had stopped breathing.

Sisyphus felt it first. The absence pressed against his bones like atmospheric pressure changing before a storm. The palace's foundation usually hummed with a rhythm so constant you forgot it was there.

Until it stopped.

"You feel it too," Daedalus said. Not a question.

"Three days now."

"Three days, seventeen hours." Daedalus's hands were shaking worse than usual. "I've been counting."

Through the window, they could see the courtyard below. Empty. No workers hauling stone. No masons mixing mortar. The quarry had been abandoned since yesterday when the last foreman fled.

A knock at the door made them both turn.

The guards, Nikias and Alexios, still on duty, let someone through. Keras stumbled into the workshop, and Sisyphus barely recognized him.

The master mason looked like he hadn't slept in days. Stone dust caked his clothes, his hair, the lines of his face. His eyes were too wide, too bright. The look of a man who'd seen something his mind refused to process.

"Master Daedalus," he managed. "Master Sisyphus. I need-" His voice cracked. "The workers are gone. All of them. They left in the night."

"We saw," Daedalus said quietly.

"You don't understand." Keras moved to the table, hands gripping the edge. "They didn't leave because of the civil war. They didn't leave because of the pay, or the danger, or the working conditions."

He looked up at them both.

"They left because of the silence."

Sisyphus exchanged a glance with Daedalus.

"Sit," Sisyphus said. "Tell us."

Keras sat heavily, like a man whose legs had forgotten their purpose. "Four days ago, we were working the eastern support chambers. Standard maintenance. Then around midday, everything just... stopped."

"What stopped?"

"The sound. The breathing. That rhythm we've all learned to work around." Keras's hand moved unconsciously to his chest, as if checking his own heartbeat. "It's been there for three years. Constant. You don't notice it until it's gone."

The door burst open.

Theron stood in the threshold, six guards behind him, all armed. His face was wrong, jaw too tight, eyes too focused. The look of a man holding himself together through pure force of will.

"The labyrinth," he said without preamble. "Something's wrong with it."

"Yes," Sisyphus said simply.

"Fix it."

"We need to investigate first. Understand what's-"

"I don't care what you need." Theron's voice was flat. Dead. "You're going down. Now. You're going to find out what's happening. And you're going to fix it."

Sisyphus looked at Keras, then at Daedalus, then back at Theron.

The workshop was silent except for breathingâ€”human breathing, natural breathing, the kind that came from living lungs instead of stone passages that learned to think.

Sisyphus stood slowly.

"We'll need supplies. Torches, rope, tools."
"Already prepared."

"And workers-"

"The workers are gone. You have Keras." Theron looked at the mason. "You're going with them."

"No," Keras said immediately. "No, I'm not going back down there. You can't make me-"

"I can make you do anything." Theron's voice was soft. Dangerous. "You either die up here, or down there, what's difference?"

Keras's face crumpled.

Sisyphus felt the old, familiar rage, the same anger that had made him chain Death itself, that had made him defy gods and kings and the fundamental nature of reality. But he pushed it down, back into the place where he kept such things. Rage was useless here.

Only precision mattered now.

"Fine," he said. "We descend. But on one condition."

"You don't make-"

"You come with us."

The workshop went silent. Even Theron's guards shifted, exchanging glances.

Theron's jaw tightened. "What?"

"You want to know what's happening down there. Come see for yourself." Sisyphus's voice was calm. Reasonable. "If it's as bad as I think, you'll need to authorize immediate action. No time for reports, debates, chain of command. You'll be there. You'll see. You'll decide."

"You're trying to-"

"I'm trying to save lives." Sisyphus met his eyes steadily. "Including yours. Because if I'm right about what's happening down there, this palace is about to have a much bigger problem than a civil war."

Theron's hand moved to his sword hilt. An old habit when thinking. Sisyphus could see the calculation happening behind his eyes.

"The men need to see you're not afraid," Sisyphus added quietly. "They're terrified. The workers fled. The masons quit. Even your guards look ready to run." He gestured to the six armed men in the doorway. "But if Lieutenant Theron descends into the depths himself, if he faces whatever's down there..."

Understanding dawned on Theron's face. Not the understanding Sisyphus intended, but something else entirely.

An opportunity.

"They'll see I'm not just giving orders," Theron said slowly. "I'm willing to face the same risks."

"Exactly."

"While Asterion cowers outside the walls." A smile touched Theron's face. The first genuine expression Sisyphus had seen from him in days. "While the Commander hides behind his soldiers, I descend into the labyrinth itself."

"Yes," Sisyphus said, knowing he was being misunderstood, knowing Theron thought this was theater, knowing it didn't matter as long as it got him down there to see the truth.

"The men will remember," Theron continued, speaking more to himself now than to them. "When this is over. When I've won. They'll remember who had the courage."

He turned to his guards. "Four of you, with us. The rest, inform the captains I'm conducting a personal inspection of the labyrinth. Make sure word spreads." He looked back at Sisyphus. "Anything else?"

"Just one thing."

"What?"

"When we get down there, when you see what I think we're going to see..." Sisyphus paused. "Listen. For once in your life, stop calculating the politics and just listen."

Theron's smile faded. Something in Sisyphus's tone, the absolute certainty, the lack of manipulation, made him hesitate.

Theron watched him for a moment, then turned to Keras. "You know the paths. You lead."

"Please," Keras whispered. "Please don't make me-"

"Lead. Or die here. Choose."

Keras's shoulders sagged in defeat.

They gathered their supplies in silence. Torches. Rope. Tools they probably wouldn't need. Four guards, hands on spears, trying to look brave and failing. Daedalus, hands shaking as he rolled up blueprints. Keras, looking like a man walking to his execution. Theron, checking his sword, his armor, preparing for theater without understanding he was preparing for truth.

And Sisyphus, feeling the absence from below pressing against his bones, knowing they were about to descend into something that had learned patience from watching him die.

At the door, Daedalus spoke quietly. "The last time you descended, you were crushed to death."

"I know."

"Try not to make it a habit."

Despite everything, Sisyphus smiled slightly. "I'll do my best."

---

They descended.

The stairwell felt different immediately. Colder. The air too still, like the palace itself was holding its breath. The torches seemed dimmer here, their light not reaching as far as it should.

Sector One opened before them: passages Sisyphus had walked a hundred times. Familiar geometry, known deceptions. The floor that tilted on pressure plates. The walls that appeared to converge but didn't.

"Stay close," Keras said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Watch for-"

One of the guards stepped forward. A younger man, maybe twenty, trying to look brave.

The floor opened beneath him.

He fell with a short, sharp scream. The sound of impact came three seconds later. Wet. Final.

The remaining three guards pressed together, spears raised against geometry.

"That wasn't supposed to open," Daedalus said quietly. His hands were shaking worse now. "That mechanism requires specific weight distribution. One man can't-"

"It's been modified," Sisyphus said. He knelt at the edge, studying the mechanism in the torchlight. Fresh tool marks. Recent work. "Someone changed the trigger threshold."

"All the way up here?" Daedalus' voice shook even more still.

They moved more carefully after that. Keras leading, testing each step. The guards behind him, weapons useless against architecture. Daedalus marking their path on his mental map. Theron silent, calculating, still thinking this was about courage and politics. And Sisyphus, feeling the wrongness grow with every step deeper.

The breathing should have started by now. The rhythmic sound that pervaded everything, that made the stone feel alive. But there was nothing. Just their footsteps. Their breathing. The crackle of torches.

"It's watching us," one of the guards whispered.

"No," Sisyphus said. The realization starting to form, that familiar feeling of the Minotaur's gaze was unmistakebly absent. "No, I don't think it is."

Sector Two. The passages that curved through impossible angles. Walls that absorbed sound in some chambers, amplified it in others. They should be hearing echoes of the breathing by now, the acoustics designed to carry that sound through every passage.

Silence.

Sector Three. They were deep now. This was where Theseus had died, where Sisyphus had carved his handholds, where the modifications had led that boy to hope and death. The feeding chambers were close. The Minotaur's domain.

Still no breathing.

"Maybe it's sleeping," a guard offered. His voice cracked with hope.

"It doesn't sleep for three days," Keras said flatly.

They rounded a corner and stopped.

The passage ahead had changed completely. Not modified. Rebuilt. The crude approximations Sisyphus had seen before were gone, replaced by sophisticated architecture that rivaled Daedalus's best work. Support columns at perfect intervals. Load-bearing arches that distributed weight flawlessly. And at the end of the passage-

Fresh air.

Not the stale, recycled air of the labyrinth. Fresh air from above, carrying the scent of the palace, of the sea beyond.

They approached slowly. The passage sloped upward at a careful angle: not too steep, not too shallow. Engineered for efficient movement. The walls were smooth, polished almost. No tool marks visible. Just clean, precise stone that seemed to flow like water frozen mid-current.

Sisyphus reached the end and stopped.

An exit. Leading up toward the palace sub-levels. Complete, but now sealed with the rubble of a purposeful cave in.

And at the threshold, scattered in the dust: footprints.

Not human footprints.

"Oh gods," Keras whispered. "Oh gods, it's already-"

"When?" Theron grabbed Sisyphus's arm. "When did it leave?"

Sisyphus knelt, studying the tracks. The dust pattern. The way the stone still held faint warmth from passage. 

"Hours ago. Maybe more." He looked up at them all. "While we were gathering supplies. While you were giving orders. While we were descending."

Understanding hit Theron's face like a physical blow. "It waited for us to come down."

"Yes."

"It wanted us out of the way."

"Yes."

"It was never the threat here. We are. The architects who might stop it, the guards who might slow it, the lieutenant who might organize a response." Sisyphus stood. "It learned patience. Strategy. How to use silence as bait."

"From you," Daedalus said quietly. "It learned from watching you die."

Theron's hand was on his sword, gripping the hilt so tight his knuckles were white. "We need to get back. Now. Warn them. Seal the sub-levels, mobilize the guards-"

A sound cut him off.

Distant. Muffled by stone and distance. But clear enough.

Screaming.

From above.

They ran.

Back through passages they'd carefully navigated. Past the traps that had killed many. Through Sector Two, Sector One, up the stairs that seemed to multiply, that seemed to stretch forever while the screaming continued above, growing louder, closer, more terrible.

Keras stumbled. A guard caught him, hauled him forward. Daedalus's breath came in ragged gasps, hands pressed against the walls for support. Theron shouted orders that no one listened to, that meant nothing here.

And Sisyphus ran, knowing they were too late, knowing the patient trap had closed perfectly, knowing the Minotaur had learned its lessons well.

The screaming grew louder.

They climbed faster.
