# Chapter 6 - The Queen's Court

Queen Pasiphaë stood before her mirror as Lysippe fastened the ceremonial brooch - a golden bull, Minos's private joke. She'd learned to bear these small cruelties without flinching.

"The King awaits in the throne room," a servant announced from the doorway.

Three weeks he'd been absent from court. Three weeks of construction reports, strange vibrations through the palace stones, and quietly moving gold to discrete accounts in Athens. Now he was back, and everyone would pretend normalcy while calculating their proximity to disaster.

---

The throne room stank of incense and fear. Every minister in their assigned positions like actors who'd memorized their marks. At the far end, Minos sat on his obsidian throne, smaller somehow despite the seat's imposing size. He'd lost weight. His robes hung like curtains on a frame. His fingers drummed against the armrest, three quick taps, pause, two slow ones, repeat.

Pasiphaë took her place on the smaller throne. The stone was cold through her robes. Minos didn't acknowledge her arrival.

"Let the session commence," he said.

Kleomenes stepped forward with the careful precision of a man who knew numbers could become nooses. The King watched him approach with an intensity that made the treasurer's steps falter.

"Your Majesty, the quarterly assessments show increased expenditure on construction materials-"

"Tell me, Kleomenes." Minos's voice was soft. Dangerous. "What is the cost of divine forgiveness?"

The treasurer blinked. "I... Your Majesty?"

"We measure everything. Grain, gold, blood. Surely the gods' mercy has a price." The fingers drummed. Three quick, two slow. "You've calculated the cost of temples. Of sacrifices. Of offerings."

Kleomenes's face had gone pale. Sweat beaded on his forehead despite the morning chill. "The gods' ways are beyond price, Your Majesty."

"Beyond price." Minos smiled without warmth. "Yet we try to buy their favor anyway." His gaze swept the crowded room, and everyone it touched flinched. "Continue."

The treasurer shuffled backward into the crowd of ministers, trying to disappear.

Three more ministers approached. Three more received philosophical tangents wrapped in accusation. Asterion's military composure cracked when questioned about loyalty. Polyidus made warding signs no one watched when his prayers were dismissed as useless. Each exchange was a variation on the same theme: Minos searching for betrayal in routine reports, finding it everywhere.

The door burst open.

A runner - young, out of breath, clearly terrified of interrupting court, stumbled forward anyway.

"Your Majesty!" he gasped. "Urgent message from the construction site!"

The court murmured. Minos's drumming fingers stopped mid-pattern.

"Speak."

The runner swallowed hard. "Your Majesty, a tribute has survived past Sector Three. The foreman reports unprecedented progress through the maze. They've - they've never seen anything like it."

The murmuring grew louder. Everyone knew about the tributes. Some had watched from a distance as Athenian youths were led into the lower passages. They didn't know the details - didn't want to know - but they understood the system. Tributes went down. Tributes didn't come back.

But Sector Three? That was deep. That was impossible.

Minos stood slowly. The court fell silent.

"How far?"

"Sector Four, Your Majesty. Still moving. The guards don't know whether to-"

"Session ended." Minos stepped down from the throne, moving toward the side exit that led to the lower passages. No explanation. No orders. No acknowledgment of the ministers standing with unfinished reports.

The court stood frozen, uncertain. Pasiphaë watched Minos disappear through the doorway. She stood, smoothing her robes.

"The King has urgent matters to attend," she announced, her voice carrying the practiced authority of someone who'd spent years covering for her husband's instability. "Resume your duties. Court will reconvene at the King's convenience."

The ministers began filing out, their relief palpable. Kleomenes moved quickly, probably heading straight to inventory what could be liquidated. Asterion conferred quietly with his officers. Polyidus stood alone, making signs of blessing that no one was watching.

Pasiphaë returned to her chambers with Lysippe following at the proper respectful distance. Only when the door closed behind them did either woman speak.

"A tribute survived past Sector Three," Lysippe said immediately, dropping the servant's deference. "That's not possible. Not unless-"

"Unless the architecture allowed it." Pasiphaë moved to her window, looking toward the distant construction site. Tiny figures moved between stone blocks. "Structure doesn't change itself. Someone changed it."

"The architects?"

"Daedalus has been terrified since he arrived. You've seen him - always calculating, always worried." She turned from the window. "But the other one..."

"The foreign architect?"

"Sisyphus." Pasiphaë pulled reports from her desk - construction schedules, worker accounts. "A man of his nature doesn't suddenly start following rules." She spread the papers across her desk. "Look. Stone dust in passages that should be sealed. Workers reporting modifications they didn't make."

"You think he's been sabotaging it?"

"I think men like that can't help themselves." She sorted the papers into piles. "The accounts in Athens are ready. The ship can be arranged within a week. If we move before Theron-"

A sound from the corner made them both freeze.

A tapestry moved. Lieutenant Theron stepped into view.

Pasiphaë's blood went cold. How long had he been there? The chamber had three entrances - the main door, the servant's passage, and the old siege tunnel. She checked the first two religiously. The third... 

"Interesting conversation, Your Majesty," Theron said calmly. 

"Lieutenant." Her voice was perfectly controlled. "The King's personal chambers are not open to military personnel."

"Forgive me, Your Majesty. I was conducting a security inspection." He gestured vaguely at the tapestry. "The old siege tunnels need to be checked regularly."

"Your diligence is noted," Pasiphaë said. "You may continue your inspection elsewhere."

"Of course, Your Majesty." He moved toward the main door, unhurried. Then paused. "Though - forgive me - I couldn't help but overhear. You mentioned the foreign architect. Sisyphus." His tone was conversational, curious. "You said 'a man of his nature.' What nature would that be?"

Pasiphaë met his gaze steadily. "He's from Corinth. They have different building philosophies there."

"Different how?"

"They question. Challenge assumptions. It makes them innovative." She kept her voice level. "Sometimes it makes them difficult to manage."

"And these... innovations." Theron's hand rested on the door frame. "Would they include modifications that help tributes survive?"

"I wouldn't know, Lieutenant. I don't inspect the construction personally."

"No. Of course not." He smiled slightly. "Though you do receive reports. Worker accounts. Construction schedules." He gestured to the papers on her desk. "Your Majesty is remarkably well-informed about the project."

The trap was visible now, closing with careful precision.

"The King's project requires oversight," Pasiphaë said. "I maintain appropriate awareness."

"Appropriate." Theron nodded slowly. "Given the tribute's unprecedented survival, it seems prudent to verify that construction proceeds according to specifications. A personal inspection of the tower. The architects' workshop."

"When?" Pasiphaë asked.

"Immediately, Your Majesty. These matters shouldn't wait." Theron bowed with precise military courtesy. "By your leave."

He walked out before she could respond. His boots echoed down the corridor with the steady rhythm of inevitability.

Pasiphaë and Lysippe stood in silence, listening to his footsteps fade.

"How much did he hear?" Lysippe whispered.

"Sisyphus's name. Modifications. Escape." Pasiphaë gathered the papers from her desk with deliberate care. "Enough for investigation. Not enough for arrest. Not yet."

"What do we do?"

"Nothing." She looked at the scattered reports - months of careful observation, now potential evidence. "We do nothing. We wait."

The golden bull brooch felt heavy on her chest. She moved to the window. Below, Theron, in his bronze armor, crossed the courtyard with purpose, heading toward the tower that rose in the distance.

She'd confessed to Theron once before, trying to save him. He'd turned her truth into a weapon. Now she'd spoken a name in what she'd thought was privacy, and he would do it again.

The pattern was clear. The outcome, inevitable.

---

Theron took the tower steps two at a time.

The tribute's survival. The Queen's speculation. The foreign architect's name. It all fit together now. Not proof yet, but a clear trail to follow.

Behind him, two guards struggled to keep pace. He didn't slow down.

The Queen's phrasing had been careful. Too careful. Not "a man of his skill" or "a man of his ambition." Nature. As if the sabotage wasn't opportunism but inevitability.

From Corinth, she'd said. But what had brought him here? What crime, what offense against the gods had landed him in Minos's service? The Queen spoke as if she knew his history. As if defiance was written into him long before he arrived on Crete.

What did she know about Sisyphus that he didn't? What history, what pattern, what fundamental nature made defiance not just likely but certain?

Three years he'd been watching the architects. Documenting their movements, their habits, their access to sensitive areas. Daedalus was careful, paranoid even - a man who understood consequences intimately and feared them appropriately. But Sisyphus worked with the casual confidence of someone who'd never faced real consequences.

Or someone who'd faced them and survived anyway.

Well. Nature could be tested. Consequences could be demonstrated.

Theron reached the tower entrance and pushed through without breaking stride.

Whatever the Queen knew about Sisyphus, he was determined to learn for himself.
