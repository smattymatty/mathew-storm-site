Queen Pasiphaë folded the third letter from Syracuse into her sleeve as footsteps approached. The supply manifests lay scattered across her desk - evidence of the bleeding. Eleven wagons this week. Seventeen last week. The exodus had begun.

Behind her, the door swung open without announcement. She already knew who it was. Even her own husband knocked before entering.

"Majesty." Lieutenant Theron's tone suggested mockery more than respect. "The execution is scheduled for the twelfth hour."

She didn't turn. "On whose authority?"

"The King's standing orders regarding desertion." His footsteps crossed her chamber uninvited. "Any attempt to flee the island constitutes treason. The harbor master made his choice."

"Minos didn't authorize-"

"The King has been occupied with his project. I simply follow his orders." 

Theron picked up one of her letters from the writing desk, not bothering to ask for permission. "Correspondence from Rhodes? Their governor seeks extensions. Syracuse made similar requests. Everyone senses weakness."

She turned to face him. He stood reading her private letters as if they were his own.

Her hand twitched toward the bronze letter opener on her desk; a habit formed after years of imagining what freedom might cost. She forced her fingers to stillness.

"The harbor master has a family," she said evenly.

"Had a family. They boarded a ship for Athens three nights ago. He was to follow yesterday." Theron set down the letter. "One of my men was waiting at the dock."

"You're executing a man for trying to reunite-"

"I'm executing a traitor." He moved toward the window. "Unless Your Majesty believes fleeing one's post is acceptable? That would send an interesting message."

Before she could respond, Lysippe appeared in the doorway. "Your Majesty, the council-"

Theron moved toward her, forcing Lysippe to step back. "Tell me, what do the servants say about today's execution?"

Lysippe's eyes flicked to the Queen. "They say... they say it's meant as warning."

"Precisely." Theron smiled. "Three kitchen staff fled two nights ago. The stable master's family departed yesterday." He circled back to the Queen. "Today's execution reminds everyone that loyalty isn't optional."

"You exceed your authority," Pasiphaë said.

"Do I? The King gave standing orders. I merely enforce them." He paused at the door. "Unless Your Majesty wishes to intervene? I'm certain he'd be fascinated to learn you're protecting deserters. He's been so... reasonable lately."

They both knew what Minos had become. To contradict Theron meant facing the King's paranoid fury.

After Theron had left, Lysippe's composure crumbled. "He's using the execution to trap everyone. Stand by and you endorse it. Refuse and-"

"And he questions my loyalty to the King." Pasiphaë moved to the window. The scaffold was nearly complete. "Tell me what the servants really say."

"They say the King hasn't slept in weeks. That Daedalus looks haunted but the new assistant looks  unchanged. He works without rest, without fear,  he's not natural." Lysippe paused. "And they say anyone who asks questions ends up missing. Like Thalia."

The curious scullery maid. Everyone knew where she'd gone. No one said it aloud.

"Theron knows we're all planning to run. This is him closing the doors." Pasiphaë said quietly.

Pasiphaë watched the scaffold take shape. By the twelfth hour, a man would die to prove a point: that no one leaves Crete. That loyalty is mandatory, and that they were all trapped on this island with the thing breathed below.

---

The execution balcony jutted from the palace's east wall, designed specifically for public displays. Three council members stood in uneasy silence, summoned by Theron's "invitation" that allowed no refusal.

Commander Asterion kept steady posture, his eyes fixed on the distant horizon. Beside him, Kleomenes gripped the marble railing with ink-stained fingers. High Priest Polyidus clutched his prayer beads,  wood clicking alongside his muttered recitations.

Below, carpenters made final adjustments to the scaffold.

"His Majesty sends his regrets." Lieutenant Theron stood at the balcony railing, arms crossed. "Affairs of state require his attention below."

Below, guards brought out the harbor master. His hands were bound, but he walked steadily. No hood covered his face - Theron wanted everyone to see.

The High Priest raised his free hand to object. "His family had already left. A man seeking to reunite with-"

"Tell me, Holy One, what do the scriptures say about duty? About loyalty to one's kingdom?" Theron's voice hardened. 

 "They also speak of mercy. Of compassion for-"

"For the faithful, yes. Not for deserters." Theron gestured to the courtyard below where workers had gathered. "These who remain. What message does pardoning a deserter send them?"

"That we are not savages," Polyidus said. "That Crete still values-"

"Crete values loyalty." Theron turned to face him fully. "Unless you believe treason should be rewarded? I'm certain His Majesty would be interested in your theological interpretation."

Polyidus opened his mouth, then closed it.

"I thought so." Theron looked to Asterion. "Commander? Any military objections to this proceeding?"

Asterion had commanded troops for decades. Had earned his scars in honest combat, leading from the front, never asking his soldiers to bleed where he wouldn't.

His nephew's shipping contracts with Athens sat on Theron's desk. Evidence of correspondence with enemy merchants. Proof enough for execution if Theron chose to interpret it that way.

During his campaigns, Asterion had won because he'd known when to hold position and when to advance. This wasn't that kind of fight. Not yet.

"None," Asterion said, his voice carrying the flatness of a tactical retreat.

"Kleomenes? As treasurer, perhaps you have economic concerns about losing a harbor master?"

Kleomenes stared at his hands.  "No concerns." he whispered.

"Excellent. Unity in leadership." Theron moved back to the railing. "The people need to see their council stands together. That we all agree: loyalty is not optional."

Below, the harbor master was led up the scaffold steps. He didn't struggle. Didn't plead. Just looked once toward the sea he'd tried to reach, then closed his eyes.

Polyidus's prayer beads clicked faster. "This is wrong."

"This is necessary," Theron said. "Watch carefully, gentlemen. This is the price of disloyalty."

The executioner raised his blade.

Polyidus turned away.

The blade fell.

Someone in the crowd shouted approval. One of Theron's men, planted there. Then another voice joined, and another. Not the whole crowd, but enough. The loyal, the frightened, the opportunistic - all cheering to be seen cheering.

The council members stood frozen.

Polyidus recognized one of the voices. A temple guard. One of his own men, now cheering for Theron.

"Dismissed," Theron said. "And remember, I have men at every port."

As they filed toward the door, Asterion's hand went to his sword hilt - an old habit when calculating odds. His fingers touched bronze, then fell away. 

Theron watched him, smile widening.

Asterion left without a word.

After they'd left, Theron remained on the balcony, watching workers return to their tasks with new urgency. The message was clear: work hard, stay loyal, or join the harbor master.

Below in the darkness, something breathed. The thing that lived beneath the palace - that was the real power in Crete now, and he intended to understand it.

Queen Pasiphaë received Theron in her formal chamber. Dressed in full regalia, he bowed without looking at her, his eyes already cataloging details - correspondence with foreign kingdoms, the trade route map on her desk.

"Sit, Lieutenant." She gestured to the chair. "We need to speak plainly."

He sat but remained rigid. "I'm listening."

She continued to study him, her fingers tracing the armrest of her chair - the same motion she used when forcing herself still during court.

She took a deep breath. "Years ago, my husband offended Poseidon. Took the god's sacred bull for himself." She watched his face as she spoke. "The curse fell on me. Not him. Me."

Her voice was steady, calmer than she felt. The anger helped, she'd learned that years ago. Learned to let it sharpen her words instead of breaking them.

"The bull was Poseidon's," she continued. "And Minos knew it. He chose pride over piety, and when the god's wrath came, it fell on me. My body and my mind became instruments of divine will, and from that abomination came what breathes below."

"Careful, Majesty." Theron's voice was soft. "Speaking ill of the King-"

"I'm not speaking ill. I'm stating fact." She leaned forward slightly. "Minos was horrified, but he was also fascinated. He couldn't kill it, whether from paternal feeling or divine prohibition, I've never been certain. So he commissioned the labyrinth."

Theron's jaw had dropped. His hand moved to his belt - not for a weapon, but for the small tablet he kept there. Taking notes. "These are serious accusations, Majesty."

She watched his stylus move across the wax tablet, recording every word. Good. He'd need those notes later - when he insisted on seeing the beast for himself. Men like Theron always needed to verify, to control, to understand.

"You're suggesting the King knowingly harbors a monster?" Theron's stylus scratched against wax. "That he's built this entire project to contain his... what are you claiming, exactly?"

"I'm claiming he's corrupted something that was already cursed and made it worse. Fed it tributes to study how it learns." Her voice went quieter. "Whatever fathered it, he claimed it as his own. He sees it as his son."

Silence.

Then Theron set down his stylus with deliberate care. "Majesty, you're clearly under great strain. Perhaps-"

"Stop." She held up a hand. "We both know what you're doing. You're deciding how to use this. Whether to report me as mad, or treasonous, or simply inconvenient." Her smile was bitter. "So decide. But don't insult me by pretending concern."

"I'm trying to help-"

"You're trying to position yourself." She stood, moving to the window. The island stretched below; beautiful, cursed, inescapable. "You think if you can prove Minos is unfit, or I'm disloyal, you can seize control." She turned back to face him "You want power, but you can't see that the throne itself is poisoned." 

"The King's authority is absolute. I merely ensure it remains so." A pause. "This conversation has been very illuminating, Majesty."

"Has it?" She moved closer, her voice dropping to something almost like pity. "I just told you the truth about divine punishment, monstrous offspring, and systematic murder. And all you heard was opportunity."

"Your honesty has been invaluable, Majesty."

After he left, she stood motionless. The vibrations through the stone pulsed stronger. The Queen felt what Theron couldn't; the breathing rhythm she'd once carried inside her.

Theron would investigate,  and he would demand proof.

He'd get it.
