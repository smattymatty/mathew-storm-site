The chains had been lighter than expected. Sisyphus could feel their weight in every link, but after an eternity of pushing stone up an endless slope, anything that didn't roll back down felt almost like freedom.

Almost.

He rolled his shoulders to test this new absence as he climbed. Where the boulder's weight had carved grooves in his bones, now only air pressed against him - a different burden entirely. Each step up the stone stairs carried him toward unknown labor. The air sharp with olive groves and sea salt, scents that he'd barely recognized.

It had been a long time since he'd breathed anything but the stale air of Tartarus.

The tower stretched upward, reminding him of his eternal ascent, only this time much more cramped. The Guard Captain climbed ahead of him, armor clanking with each step. He checked over his shoulder twice, unnecessarily. Where could Sisyphus run that the gods couldn't find him? As they climbed past arrow slits that framed glimpses of the awakening palace below, Sisyphus understood that this was reassignment rather than rescue.

"Here," the Guard Captain grunted. He stopped before a heavy wooden door, inserted a small key that scraped against the ancient metal, then pushed.

The door creaked open, revealing the workshop. Mathematical instruments cluttered every surface, and architectural drawings covered the walls: blueprints for structures that seemed to shift when viewed directly.

Sisyphus stepped inside. The floor beneath his feet thrummed subtly, easy to miss if you weren't used to feeling stone. A rhythmic pulse: three beats, pause, two beats. Like a heartbeat counting itself from deep below.

When he turned his attention back to the workshop, movement caught his eye. In the chamber's center, a man worked hunched over the largest table.

"Daedalus," the Guard Captain said, voice echoing off the curved stone walls. "Your assistant has arrived."

The hunched figure straightened slowly, then turned with the careful precision of a man who measured every movement. His eyes studied Sisyphus with calculating intensity, as if already envisioning how this new piece might fit into whatever impossible puzzle he was solving.

"Sisyphus of Corinth," Daedalus said, his cultured voice roughened at the edges.

Sisyphus blinked. He'd assumed his name had faded from mortal memory, yet this man spoke it with casual familiarity.

Daedalus gestured to the chaos of scrolls. "I just heard news of your arrival, the palace walls carry sound well." His eyes flicked toward the Guard Captain, then back. He pressed his palms flat against the largest scroll, steadying himself. "Please. Make yourself comfortable."

The architectural plans writhed in the lamplight - corridors that connected to themselves, symbols that shifted when he wasn't looking directly at them. Sisyphus traced a passage with his finger. The ink pulled away from his touch like water from oil, then, when his finger stopped moving, it flowed back, following the path his finger had just taken. It was learning the pattern, remembering. He jerked his hand away and the ink settled, but now the passage he'd traced was slightly different. As if it had taken notes. His eyes watered trying to follow the new geometry.

"What am I looking at?" Sisyphus asked with a steady voice, despite the wrongness of what he saw.

"The perfect prison," Daedalus whispered, his stylus tapping against the table. "King Minos has commissioned us to build something that has never existed before."

Sisyphus studied the impossible geometries, his fingers unconsciously tracing the corridors, even still.

"A maze that thinks, that learns, that adapts to its prey." Daedalus's voice dropped lower. "It's meant to contain something that cannot be killed, cannot be reasoned with, and must never be allowed to escape."

He paused, and in the silence Sisyphus could smell the fear-sweat beneath Daedalus's scholarly composure.

"What kind of creature requires a prison like this?" Sisyphus asked.

The Captain's hand drifted to his sword hilt, a subtle warning that some questions were too dangerous to ask directly.

"The kind," Daedalus said carefully, "that learns from every previous encounter. That remembers every failed escape attempt and grows stronger from..."

Daedalus glanced at the Captain as he trailed off.

"Enough," the Captain said flatly, not wanting to learn more than he needed to know. "The King expects progress reports every three days," He paused for a moment, "In fact, he wishes to inspect your progress this very morning. You have until the tenth hour."

"Questions will not be tolerated." He let that sink in before continuing, his voice taking on the flat tone of someone reciting execution orders. "Neither will unauthorized creativity."

Sisyphus met his eyes. "What kind of creativity concerns him?"

The Captain's jaw tightened, but he answered. "The kind that makes architects think they're anything more than tools." He paused, deliberately. "You'll learn."

Sisyphus nodded. After endless repetition, he knew how threats worked: they revealed the threatener's fears. This one feared creativity, which meant the system had gaps. The guard had just outlined where to look.

After the Captain's bootfalls had faded down the spiral stairs, Daedalus collapsed into his chair as if invisible puppet strings had been severed. The leather creaked under his weight, releasing the scent of old fear.

"Charming fellow," Sisyphus observed.

"He's executed three architects before us," Daedalus said with forced casualness. "Minos values results over lives."

He reached for his wine cup as the first light of dawn crept through the eastern window, lifting it with desperate hands in what seemed like ritual. The liquid was sour, but he drank deeply anyway.

"I once built temples in Athens," he said quietly, staring into the cup. "Places where people came to find hope, to celebrate beauty." His voice carried the weight of loss, his head shook without his will. "Now I calculate the most efficient ways for hope to die." He took his final gulp, but it couldn't wash away what he'd just admitted.

The old man collected himself, his scholarly composure returned. He grabbed the stylus and got back to work.

Sisyphus watched Daedalus return to the center table, how he stared at his own blueprints like a man reading his own confession. Sisyphus knew that look. Had worn it himself, back when he still bothered to count the number of times the boulder rolled back down.

"What did you do?" Sisyphus asked quietly.

Daedalus's stylus stopped mid-scratch. "What do you mean?"

"To end up here. In this tower, building cages instead of cathedrals." Sisyphus leaned back, the stool groaning beneath him. "Men like us don't fall from grace by stumbling. We make choices that shatter us like-"

"The question," Daedalus interrupted, his voice sharp enough to cut, "is what you did." The stylus in his fingers went perfectly still - too still. "What manner of crime earns a king eternal servitude to Minos?"

"You want honesty?" Sisyphus asked, rolling his shoulders until the joints cracked. "I cheated death, twice. That angered the gods. Badly enough that Tartarus seemed merciful compared to what they could have done."

Daedalus's stylus stopped mid-stroke. "Twice?"

"First time: Thanatos. Second time: Persephone." Sisyphus studied his scarred palms. "My punishment was... repetitive. They wanted to teach me patience through endless labor. I think they succeeded, though probably not in the way they intended."

The silence stretched. Daedalus set down his stylus with exaggerated care.

"You must never," Daedalus said, each word precisely enunciated, "speak of divine punishment within these walls. The palace is fanatically devout. Your past stays buried."

"And yours?"

Daedalus's stylus stopped. His free hand moved to his chest, an unconscious gesture, fingers pressing against something round and metal underneath his tunic. "Everyone serves something, Sisyphus." His expression was carefully empty. "We all have something we can't afford to lose." A clear dismissal.

"Now," Daedalus said, unrolling a different scroll with the brisk efficiency of someone changing an uncomfortable subject, "let me show you the feeding chambers."

The blueprint was smaller but more disturbing. Passages that spiraled inward with mathematical inevitability.

"A whole chamber, for feeding?" Sisyphus asked.

Daedalus reached for a hidden drawer. "Athens sends... payment. Every seven years. Fourteen of them." He couldn't quite look at Sisyphus. "The beast must be fed, or it will break free." His hand rested on the drawer handle. He didn't open it. Just clutched it, like a man steadying himself against a storm.

"Fourteen what?" Sisyphus asked, though something in Daedalus's tone had already given him the answer.

"Does it matter?" Daedalus's voice went cold. "They're dead either way. Our job is to make the system work."

Something tightened in Sisyphus's chest - an old ache he'd thought Tartarus had ground out of him. He said nothing. But his finger, still tracing the feeding chamber passage, had gone still.

Daedalus rolled up the scroll before Sisyphus could study it further. "We have two hours before Minos expects us. Questions about ethics can wait until after we've ensured our own survival."

Sisyphus pondered the blueprints with new understanding. A maze that learned from death.  Could it learn from survival too? The thought made him smile slightly. The same smile he'd worn the day he'd chained Death itself. First, he needed to understand what they were building. Then, perhaps, he could discover what else it might become.

The lamp flame guttered in a draft from the window, casting dancing shadows across the walls. In that flickering light, Daedalus's hands moved with practiced efficiency across the feeding chamber blueprints. This was a man who could design hope itself as a weapon.

"The beast," Sisyphus said slowly. "What exactly is it?"

Daedalus dropped his stylus. "Something that should never have been born." He pulled out a piece of charcoal and began sketching on a scrap of papyrus. "Half bull, half man. The palace calls it the Minotaur, as if naming it could contain what it truly is. When it first arrived, it was just rage and hunger. But each group of tributes teaches it something new."

The charcoal moved across the paper in quick, nervous strokes. "It remembers their tactics, their hiding places. The last group built a barricade. The beast didn't just break through it, it used the pieces to trap them."

For a moment, the sketch revealed something horrifying: not just bull and man fused, but intelligence gleaming in graphite eyes, a mouth curved in what might have been a smile. The thing on the paper seemed to watch them back.

"What happens when it outgrows the maze?" Sisyphus asked.

"When it breaks free" He stopped. Started again. "If the labyrinth fails, Crete-" The charcoal snapped in his grip. He stared at the broken pieces, then swept them into the lamp flame. "It won't stop. That's all you need to know."

The sound of boots on stone stairs announced the Guard Captain's return before his scarred face appeared in the doorway. Behind him came two younger guards carrying a wooden tray laden with bread, cheese, watered wine, and olives that gleamed like dark jewels in the morning light.

"Your morning meal," the Captain announced, though his tone suggested this was a chore rather than a courtesy. "Eat quickly. King Minos wishes to inspect your progress. Now."

Daedalus's head snapped up, stylus clattering to the table. "Now? But we still have-"

"The King," the Captain said with flat finality, "does not concern himself with your timeline. He concerns himself with results." His flint-gray eyes fixed on Daedalus. "Both of you will present yourselves in the throne room. Come prepared to demonstrate your understanding of the project's requirements."

The guards deposited the tray and filed out, but the Captain lingered in the doorway. His hand rested on his sword hilt as he studied them both with the patient gaze of a predator sizing up prey.

"Don't keep him waiting," he said, then turned and left without another word.

The door closed with a heavy thud.

Daedalus stared at the wooden barrier for a long moment, then turned to face Sisyphus with eyes that had gone flat and calculating.

"Three hours," he said as he picked up a piece of bread. "We have three hours to convince a mad king that two men can accomplish what should take months of planning."

Sisyphus picked up his wine cup, the morning light through the window catching the liquid's surface. "What exactly does he expect to see?"

"Proof that we understand the scope of the project. Evidence that we've grasped not just the architecture, but the... philosophy behind it." Daedalus began spreading out fresh scrolls with quick, economical movements. "Minos doesn't just want a prison. He wants..." Daedalus gestured at the blueprints, searching for words. "Elaborate theater. Each group teaches the next how to die better."

The architect's stylus moved across the papyrus with sudden, urgent precision. "We need to show him modifications - improvements to contain a beast that's grown stronger since the last tribute. New chambers to replace the ones it destroyed during its last frenzy. Passages that account for its learning, its adaptation."

As Daedalus worked, Sisyphus found himself studying the man's profile. The desperate energy in his movements wasn't mere professional pride - it was the frantic calculation of a man balancing invisible weights. Each line he drew seemed to cost him something irreplaceable.

Sisyphus reached for the bread, noting how the liquid in his cup trembled with each distant vibration through the stone, rhythmic and wrong, like a pulse through veins that shouldn't exist. Three beats, pause, two beats. The same pattern that would define his cursed existence on Crete.
