# Chapter 17 - The Rampage

They emerged into daylight at a run.

Sisyphus first, then Daedalus gasping behind him, then the guards, then Keras stumbling, then Theron shouting orders no one was following.

The screaming had stopped.

That was worse.

Sisyphus hit the courtyard at full speed, momentum carrying him forward three steps before his brain processed what his eyes were seeing.

He stopped.

The eastern wall was rubble. Just... gone. Stone that had stood for generations reduced to scattered debris, dust still hanging in the air. The violence of it was breathtaking, not the careful demolition of engineering but raw force applied without precision.

And the bodies.

Three of them. Maybe four,it was hard to tell. Torn apart with the efficiency of hunger, of something that had learned to kill quickly because slow meant suffering and suffering meant thinking and thinking meant-

Sisyphus's legs gave out.

He dropped to his knees in the courtyard, staring at the carnage. At the blood soaking into stone. At the weapons scattered uselessly. At the two sacks of grain split open and trampled, grain mixing with blood and dust into paste.

They'd been fighting over grain.

And something starving had found them.

The thought came clear and sharp: This is my fault.

The handholds. The modifications. The mercy he'd coded into stone. Every choice he'd made to give tributes a chance, to teach the Minotaur patience, to show it that compassion mattered—

All of it had led here.

To this.

"Sisyphus-" Daedalus's voice, distant, concerned.

He couldn't breathe. The air in his lungs felt wrong. Ten thousand years of pushing a boulder, of watching it roll back, of starting over and over and over-

But those were just stones. Just him. Just failure that hurt no one but himself.

This was different.

These were people. Dead because he'd taught a monster to wait. Dead because he'd been so convinced mercy mattered that he'd-

"Sisyphus." Daedalus's hand on his shoulder. Firm. "Look at me."

He couldn't. Couldn't look away from the bodies. From the proof of his failure written in blood and bone.

"LOOK AT ME."

The command in Daedalus's voice cut through. Sisyphus looked up.

Daedalus was staring at the wall. Not at the bodies. At the rubble. His eyes tracking the pattern of destruction with the cold assessment of someone reading blueprints.

"The wall," Daedalus said quietly. His voice had that distant quality it got when he was calculating, when the architect took over from the man. "Look at how it broke."

"I don't-"

"LOOK."

Sisyphus forced himself to see it. The rubble. The pattern.

"Single impact point," Daedalus continued, stylus appearing in his hand like magic, sketching invisible diagrams in the air. "Tremendous force. No finesse. Pure necessity." He moved closer to the debris, studying. "It broke through because it HAD to. Because hunger doesn't allow for precision."

"What does that-"

"Now look at the door."

Sisyphus turned. The palace entrance stood intact. The massive doors carved with bulls and dolphins-

Open. Not broken. OPEN.

Daedalus walked to it, running his hands along the hinges with something like reverence. "The hinges are undamaged. The balance is perfect. The door swung open exactly as designed." He looked back at Sisyphus. "It didn't break this. It used it."

The fog in Sisyphus's mind started to clear.

"It broke the wall out of necessity," Daedalus said, voice gaining energy now, the excitement of discovery overriding everything else. "But when it reached the door, when it had time to think, when hunger wasn't in control, it chose preservation over destruction."

He turned fully to Sisyphus, and there was something almost manic in his eyes.

"Don't you understand? It appreciated the craft. It recognized the work and honored it. That's not a monster. That's-"

"An architect," Sisyphus finished quietly.

"YES." Daedalus gripped his shoulders. "Everything you taught it, patience, precision, respect for good work, it LEARNED. It's not just escaping. It's becoming something."

Sisyphus looked at the bodies again. The blood. The violence.

"But they're still dead."

"Yes." Daedalus didn't flinch from it. "They're dead because it was starving. Because we trapped something intelligent in the dark and fed it just enough to survive. Because-" He stopped. "Because we built this. You and me. We're responsible."

"Then how-"

"We're not responsible for what it was. But for what it's BECOMING." Daedalus pulled him to his feet. "The door, Sisyphus. It preserved the door. That's choice. That's growth."

Behind them, Theron was screaming orders at his guards.

"-secure the perimeter! Barricade the entrances! Someone find Commander Asterion, we need-"

But the guards weren't moving. They stared at the bodies. At the wall. At the impossibility of everything they'd been told was contained.

One guard dropped his spear. It clattered on stone.

"We can't fight that," he whispered.

"YOU CAN AND YOU WILL!" Theron's voice cracked. His hand was on his sword, knuckles white, but his face had gone grey. The control he'd maintained for days, the leverage, the threats - all of it evaporating like water on hot stone.

Then something shifted in his expression. The panic receding. Calculation returning. His eyes moved from the bodies to the palace entrance to the guards to Sisyphus.

"No," he said quietly. Then louder: "No. This is - this changes everything."

"Lieutenant?" One of the guards looked hopeful. Desperate for someone to tell them what to do.

"The beast is loose. Inside the palace." Theron's voice steadied as he spoke, as the plan formed. "Asterion's forces outside don't know. The King and Queen-" He stopped. "They're unprotected. The royal guard is scattered. The palace is chaos."

Sisyphus saw it happen. Watched Theron's mind pivot from containment to opportunity. From fear to ambition.

"We go in," Theron continued, voice gaining strength. "We secure the royal chambers. We protect the King and Queen from the beast." He looked at his men. "And when it's over, when the dust settles, they'll remember who kept them safe. Who had the courage to face the monster while Asterion cowered outside."

"Sir, that thing just tore through a wall-"

"It's an ANIMAL!" Theron snapped. "Dangerous, yes. But animals can be herded. Driven. Contained." His eyes were bright now. Feverish. "And in the chaos, in the confusion - accidents happen. The King is already mad. The Queen exposed. If the beast reaches them first..."

He didn't finish. Didn't need to.

Sisyphus understood completely. Theron saw the Minotaur not as threat but as scapegoat. A convenient tragedy. The King and Queen dead, Asterion locked outside, and Theron heroically fighting to save them but arriving too late.

Perfect theater.

"You're going to get them killed," Sisyphus said quietly.

Theron turned to him. "I'm going to SAVE them." The lies left his teeth with a crooked grin.

"I'm going with you," Sisyphus said.

Theron laughed. "Why? So you can apologize to the corpses?"

"So I can try to stop you from making this worse."

"Worse?" Theron's laugh was ugly now. "Look around, architect. This IS worse. And it's YOUR doing. Your handholds. Your mercy. Your-" He stopped. Breathed. "But you're right. You should come. You built it. You can help contain it."

Theron started toward the palace entrance. Sword drawn now. Back straight. Playing the role of hero even though everyone watching knew better.

Sisyphus looked at the open door. At the preserved hinges. At the evidence of choice made by something everyone called monster.

They entered the palace together.

Theron leading with false courage. His guards following with real fear. Keras staying behind, refusing to go deeper. And the two architects walking into darkness because someone had to try to fix what they'd broken.

Even if it meant watching another man die.

The palace halls were silent. No screaming now. No sounds of destruction.

Just the distant echo of something massive moving through corridors designed for humans.

And somewhere, faint but growing clearer, the sound of singing.

A lullaby. Ancient. Cretan.

A mother's voice calling to her son.

Theron heard it too. His face twisted with something like triumph.

"The Queen," he said. "She's trying to calm it. How... touching."

He moved faster now. Toward the sound. Toward opportunity.

Sisyphus followed.

Knowing exactly how this would end.

And powerless to stop it.

Again.

---

The palace halls were beautiful.

The Minotaur hadn't expected that. In the labyrinth, everything was functional. Passages built to contain, to confuse, to trap. Even the Minotaur's own work, sophisticated as it had become, served only purpose.

But here. Here was different.

Columns carved with spirals that served no structural purpose. Mosaics on walls depicting dolphins, octopi, waves frozen in stone. Frescoes showing bulls leaping, dancers moving, life captured in pigment and plaster.

Daedalus's work. All of it.

The architect who'd caged him had also made this. Had poured craft into every surface, beauty into every corner, as if making things beautiful was as necessary as making them stand.

The Minotaur moved slowly through the halls. Not charging. Not destroying. Just... seeing. Touching columns with scarred fingers, feeling the spiral patterns, understanding the choices made in every curve.

A mosaic caught its attention. A bull in a field of flowers, surrounded by figures in worship. Sacred. Honored. Before-

A sound.

Footsteps. Rapid. Frightened.

Two figures rounded the corner. A woman helping another woman, one limping badly, both moving toward the inner chambers.

They saw him.

Froze.

The Minotaur's vision focused.

The limping one. Small. Terrified. With a leg bound in splints that-

Memory crashed through. Not clear. Fragmented. Stone passages. Breathing. The girl dying. The architect who - who had-

The hunger returned. Not the desperate starvation from before. Something else. Something about patterns incomplete, about problems unsolved, about-

The rage mixed with it. Confusion. This girl shouldn't be here. Should be dead or gone or still below where things made SENSE where the rules were simple where-

The Minotaur charged.

Not deciding. Just moving. The body taking over from the mind that was trying to process too many contradictions at once.

The women ran.

The limping one stumbled. The other one caught her, half-carried her. They crashed through a door, slammed it shut.

The Minotaur hit the door with its shoulder.

Wood splintered. The beautiful carved frame - Daedalus's work, careful joinery, years of craft - shattered.

They were gone. Through another passage. Deeper into the maze.

The Minotaur stopped in the wreckage.

Looked at the destroyed doorframe. At splinters scattered across stone. At beauty broken because hunger and confusion had overridden thought.

Wrong. This was wrong. The door had been good work. Had deserved preservation. Had-

But the girl. The memory. The incomplete pattern that needed - what? What did it need?

A sound appeared behind the beast.

Singing.

The Minotaur turned.

A woman stood at the end of the hall. Not running. Not hiding. Just standing there, small and fragile, facing something that had just torn through a door.

Singing.

The melody touched something. Not memory exactly. Something deeper. Something that existed before language, before thought, before the cage taught it what isolation meant.

The woman stepped closer. Still singing. Her voice steady despite everything: the blood, the destruction, the wrongness of a thing like the Minotaur standing in a place meant for humans.

The rage surged. She was APPROACHING. Prey didn't approach. Prey ran or fought or died but it didn't just WALK TOWARD-

But the singing. The melody wrapping around the rage, not stopping it but complicating it. Making it harder to act on pure instinct.

The woman's face. Something about her face. About the way she looked at him. Not with fear exactly. With something else. Something the Minotaur couldn't name because nothing in the labyrinth had ever looked at it like-

Doors crashed open.

Men in armor. A man at the front with a sword, face twisted with false courage.

"THERE! Protect the Queen! KILL IT!"

He charged.

The interruption crystallized the rage into something simple again. Threat. Response. No confusion here. Just-

The Minotaur's arm moved.

A swipe. Casual. The way you'd brush debris off a work surface.

The man hit the wall. Skull cracking. Blood. Body sliding down leaving red streaks. Settling into stillness. The mouth that once shouted orders, now silent against stone.

The death barely registered. The Minotaur's attention already back on the woman, on the singing that had stopped, on the-

Another man appeared. Running between them. Arms spread. No weapon.

The architect.

The one who'd carved handholds. Who'd faced death in the feeding chamber. Who'd spoken about mercy mattering, about choices, about—

He'd DIED. The Minotaur remembered. Remembered the ribs breaking under pressure. Remembered studying the body afterward, trying to understand why someone would sacrifice themselves for another. Remembered the confusion of it.

But here he was. Alive. Standing. Impossible.

The confusion hit like physical force.

Dead things didn't return. The labyrinth taught that lesson clearly. What died stayed dead. Tributes came, tributes died, tributes stayed dead. That was the pattern. That was the RULE.

But this one had broken it.

And the confusion about broken rules always led to-

The rage surged. Hot. Simple. Better than confusion. Rage made sense. Rage had direction.

"Remember me?!" the man shouted. "I'm the one-"

"STOP, YOU FOOL!" The woman's voice cut through like a blade. "NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR YOUR USELESS HEROICS!"

The man froze. Looked back at her. Hurt and confusion on his face.

"But you-"

"I don't need SAVING!" Her voice sharp. Commanding. "Move! NOW!"

The architect stood there. Just... stood there. The Minotaur could see him processing. Watching him understand something. Watching the hurt turn to comprehension turn to-

Acceptance.

He stepped aside. Slowly. Arms lowering. No resistance. No argument. Just... surrender.

But not the surrender of defeat. Something else. Something that looked like-

Trust. The Minotaur did not recognize it.

The confusion doubled. Tripled. 

And he was looking at the Minotaur now. Direct. Steady. The same look from the feeding chamber. Like seeing something that mattered instead of something to fear.

The rage built higher. Hotter. The confusion feeding it. Too many patterns broken. Too many rules violated. The dead returning. The prey protecting. The surrender without defeat. None of it made SENSE and when things didn't make sense the only answer was-

The woman stepped forward.

Between the Minotaur and the architect now. Small. Fragile. Facing something that could kill her with one movement.

She began singing again.

Her hand reached into her robes. Pulled out cloth. Began unwrapping it.

The Minotaur's vision locked on her hands. On the careful movements. On the way she handled whatever was wrapped there like it mattered more than her own life.

The cloth fell away.

Gold caught lamplight.

A brooch. Shaped like a bull. Old. Worn smooth from years of handling. Simple. Beautiful. Perfect.

She held it out. Not as offering. As... recognition. As proof of something. As-

The rage fractured.

The woman's face. Her eyes. Brown. The same eyes that looked back from still water. The same eyes that had looked down when the world was small and warm and safe and-

Before.

The word didn't make sense. There was no before. Only the labyrinth. Only darkness. Only stone and hunger and isolation. That was all there had ever been. That was all the Minotaur had remembered.

But the eyes. The melody. The brooch.

The memory wasn't clear. Wasn't complete. Just fragments. Being held. Being warm. Those eyes looking down with something that wasn't fear, wasn't hunger, wasn't any of the things the Minotaur had learned to recognize in the darkness.

Something else.

Something the Minotaur had no word for because the labyrinth had never taught it. Because isolation didn't have a word for what happened when you weren't isolated.

The sound that came out wasn't quite animal, wasn't quite human. Somewhere between. From the place in the chest where rage and confusion and something breaking collided.

The massive frame shook. Trembled. Not from threat. Not from hunger. From something structural giving way. From years of holding itself rigid against stone walls, against hunger, against isolation - all of it releasing at once.

The woman stepped closer. Right there now. The brooch still held out. Still singing that melody that pulled at something older than memory, older than words, older than rage.

The Minotaur's hand reached forward. Scarred from working stone. Stained with blood from the courtyard. Trembling with exhaustion from years of being what it had to be to survive.

Took the brooch.

The weight was nothing. A few ounces of gold. Meaningless.

Everything.

The woman's hand touched its face. Gentle. Like touching something precious. Something that deserved gentleness despite everything, despite the blood, despite the bodies, despite-

The Minotaur's legs gave out.

Not wounded. Not dying. The strength that had broken walls, that had survived years of darkness, that had built passages in silence, it had been released.

It sank to its knees. The brooch clutched against its chest. The woman's hand still on its face. The melody still wrapping around the confusion, around the exhaustion, around the simple truth that fighting was over.

The Minotaur's breathing slowed. Deep. Each exhale releasing tension held for so long the body had forgotten it was tense.

The Minotaur's eyes closed.

Not surrendering. Not defeated.

Just-

Resting.

Finally.
