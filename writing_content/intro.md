# Writing

Exploring the intersection of technology and philosophy.

## Themes

Digital sovereignty, the federated web, and what it means to build human-centered infrastructure.

Recursive absurdism, techno-absurdism - how we create technology that respects human agency rather than extracting from it.

## Recent Thinking

The federated social web isn't just a technical architecture - it's a political statement about who controls our digital infrastructure.

Self-hosted systems aren't for hobbyists. They're how organizations maintain sovereignty and transparency.

Technology and philosophy are inseparable. The tools we build encode values.
