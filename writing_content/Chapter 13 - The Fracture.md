# Chapter 13 - The Fracture

Theron had his threats prepared.

Four days of civil war had taught him the value of leverage. Asterion controlled the gates, but Theron held the palace interior, including the architects. Including Sisyphus.

The immortal architect was the key. The man who'd fallen from the sky, who couldn't die, who the entire palace now whispered about in equal parts terror and awe. If Theron controlled him, he controlled the narrative.

He descended to the cells with six guards. The northwestern passage was collapsing - reports had come in overnight. Without the architects working, the entire labyrinth would fail. And if the labyrinth failed while they were fighting a civil war...

No. He needed Sisyphus working. Needed him compliant.

He'd prepared the right threats. Not death, that didn't work. But Daedalus. The workers. The random servants Sisyphus seemed to care about for no reason. Theron would hurt them until the architect cooperated.

Simple. Effective.

The cell door was still sealed. Guards at attention.

"Open it."

The guard fumbled with keys, pushed the door wide.

Theron stepped inside.

Empty.

He stared at the vacant cell. Torch still burning. Water cup on the floor. And there, in the corner, a gap in the wall barely visible unless you were looking for it.

His prepared threats died in his throat.

"When?" His voice came out strangled.

The guards at the door exchanged glances. "Sir, we've been here all night. No one passed-"

"WHEN DID HE ESCAPE?"

"We don't know, sir. The last meal delivery was-"

Theron pushed past them, back into the corridor. His mind racing. The architect was loose. Could be anywhere. Could have joined Asterion already. Could have-

The tower.

Of course.

He ran.

---

Through corridors that were his domain. Past patrols that snapped to attention, confused by his urgency. Down passages where bloodstains from three days ago still marked the stone.

His thoughts spiraled. The immortal architect loose during a civil war. The man everyone feared and whispered about. If Asterion got to him first, divine legitimacy for his rebellion.

Everything Theron had built, the leverage, the threats, the careful system of control, crumbling because one man wouldn't stay imprisoned.

The tower entrance came into view. Two guards there.

Nikias and Alexios.

Both standing alert now, hands on spears. Their faces carefully blank.

Theron didn't slow. "When did he pass?"

"Sir?" Nikias's voice was neutral.

"The prisoner. Sisyphus. When did he come through here?"

A pause. Too long. Too careful.

"We didn't see anyone, sir."

Theron stopped. Looked at them both. Exhausted men who'd been on duty for three days. Men with families. Men he'd threatened more times than he could count.

Men who were lying to his face.

"You're guarding the tower."

"Yes, sir."

"And you saw nothing."

"Nothing, sir."

He could execute them. Should execute them. Theron's eye twitched.

But if he killed the guards, the architects would hear. And then Sisyphus would... what? Escape again? Stop working? Something worse?

Theron pushed past them, took the stairs three at a time.

The workshop door was closed. He hit it with his shoulder, guards scrambling behind him.

The door crashed open.

Sisyphus and Daedalus stood at the worktable. Blueprints spread between them. Tools organized in neat rows. Two wine cups ready on the table. A lamp burning steady.

They looked up. Not startled. Not afraid. Just... interrupted.

Like this was any other morning.

Like the last three days were nothing.

Sisyphus straightened, wiping stone dust from his hands. "The northwestern passage is collapsing. We're fixing it."

His voice was calm. Patient. The same tone he'd use to explain anything technical.

"You escaped." Theron snapped against Sisyphus' uncanny calmness.

"Yes."

"And came here?" The word came out wrong. Too much disbelief.

"Where else would I go?" 

The question hung in the air. Theron's mind supplied answers: Asterion's camp, the harbor, anywhere that made sense, anywhere with strategy or purpose or-

But looking at Sisyphus's face, standing there covered in stone dust with a blueprint in his hand, Theron understood.

There was nowhere else.

For this man, there had never been anywhere else.

"I had threats prepared," Theron heard himself say. "About Daedalus. About the workers. About-" He stopped. "It doesn't matter, does it?"

"No," Sisyphus said simply.

Theron's hand tightened. His prepared speech dissolved. All the leverage he'd mapped out, the pressure points, the ways to make the architect compliant-

None of it mattered.

"You're going to keep working." Not a question. A realization. "No matter what I do."

"The northwestern passage needs reinforcement," Sisyphus said. "If we don't fix it, people will die. Probably servants first, they use those corridors. Then guards. Then whoever else happens to be nearby when it collapses."

It wasn't a threat. Just fact. Stated calmly, like explaining geometry.

Theron looked at Daedalus, who'd been silent through all of this. The older architect's hands were shaking slightly, but he didn't move. Didn't speak. Just stood there beside his partner.

The realization spread through Theron like ice water.

He had no leverage. No threats that worked. No power over a man who'd chosen his prison and would stay in it voluntarily.

"Get out," Theron said to his guards.

They hesitated.

"NOW!"

The door closed. Three men in the workshop. Theron unseathed a sword he knew he couldn't use.

Theron's hand was shaking. From something worse than anger. The terror of powerlessness. Of watching everything he'd built mean nothing.

"You terrify me," he said finally.

Sisyphus tilted his head slightly. "Why?"

"Because you don't care. About threats. About power. About any of it. You'll just keep working, forever."

"Not forever," Sisyphus corrected. "Just until the work is done."

"The work is never done. That's the point. The labyrinth always needs maintenance. There's always something."

"Yes." Sisyphus picked up a stylus. "There is."

The silence stretched.

Theron sheathed his sword. The click of metal on leather seemed too loud in the workshop.

He walked to the door. Hand on the latch. Stopped.

"I don't understand you."

"I know," Sisyphus said, already turning back to the blueprint.

Theron left. His hand was still shaking.

In the corridor, Nikias and Alexios stood at attention. Neither spoke. Neither asked what happened.

They'd already chosen their side.

And Theron couldn't do anything about it.

He descended the tower stairs, mind spinning. The civil war continued. Asterion held the gates. The palace fractured further every day.

And somewhere in that tower, two men worked on a passage that was always collapsing.

They'd keep working no matter what happened.

That thought should have comforted him: at least the labyrinth wouldn't fail.

Instead it terrified him.

---

Captain Prokles of the royal legion arrived at midday with his reports.

The Queen was standing at the window when he entered, watching smoke rise from the eastern courtyard where another skirmish had ended. Lysippe sat at the desk, organizing messages.

"Your Majesty." Prokles bowed. "The morning's developments."

She turned from the window. "Go on."

"The eastern warehouse fell to Commander Asterion's forces. No casualtiesâ€”Lieutenant Theron's men withdrew before engagement."

"Theron is consolidating." Not a question.

"Yes, Your Majesty. He's pulled back to the inner palace, the tower, and the main armory. Defensible positions."

The Queen moved to the desk where maps lay spread. Colored markers showed territorial control: blue for Theron's palace guards, bronze for Asterion's military, purple and gold for the royal legion. A thin corridor of purple connected the King's chambers to her wing.

"We're the buffer," She said.

"Yes, Your Majesty."

She studied the map. Three factions. None strong enough to win. All strong enough to make the others bleed.

"Casualties?" She asked.

"Seventeen wounded today. Three dead, two of Asterion's, one servant caught in crossfire."

The Queen's hand tightened on the desk edge. "The tribute youths?"

"Most escaped during the initial chaos. We've confirmed eight made it to the harbor. Three were killed in the fighting. The remaining three..." Prokles hesitated. "Unknown, Your Majesty."

Missing. Lost in a palace at war. Probably dead.

"And the labyrinth?" Lysippe asked.

"The masons sent word. The northwestern passage is failing. They need to descend to repair it, but Lieutenant Theron won't authorize access."

"Of course he won't." The Queen moved back to the window. "He thinks controlling the architects gives him leverage."

Prokles was quiet for a moment. Then: "Your Majesty, there's another matter."

The Queen's shoulders tensed slightly. She knew what was coming.

"The King?"

"Yes, Your Majesty." Prokles chose his words carefully. "He's... not well."

She turned to face him. "He hasn't been for a while now." After playing her role for so long, it felt good to finally be honest.

"He won't eat. Paces his chambers constantly. Talks to himself, -or to people who aren't there. The finger-drumming..." He demonstrated the pattern unconsciously. "It's constant now. Day and night."

"What does he talk about?"

"The architects. The Minotaur. The tribute who survived." Prokles paused. "He keeps asking if Theseus has been contained."

"Theseus died weeks ago."

"Yes, Your Majesty. We've told him. Multiple times. But ten minutes later he asks again." Another pause. "He also asks if the labyrinth is complete. Over and over. 'Is it complete yet? Has Daedalus finished?' We tell him yes. It's been complete for years. But he doesn't remember."

The Queen's hand moved to the bull brooch at her throat. "Does he remember the civil war?"

"Sometimes. Other times he asks why the tribute ceremony was cancelled. Or demands to know why Commander Asterion isn't at his post." Prokles's voice dropped. "Your Majesty, he's fracturing. The curse is eating him from the inside."

The Queen absorbed this. She'd watched it happen slowly over the years. But the last week had accelerated everything. Reality breaking, the impossible made visible, and Minos's carefully constructed world of control crumbling.

"Should we intervene?" Prokles asked. "The physicians-"

"No." Her voice was firm. "Keep him comfortable. Keep him safe. But away from decisions."

Understanding passed between them. Unspoken but clear.

"Yes, Your Majesty."

The Queen sighed. She knew the King was incapable of winning this kind of war. She didn't even want to win, only to survive. If survival meant taking control of the throne for now, so be it. She remembered her warning to Theron: "The throne itself is poisoned". She tried to save him, and now here she was, seizing power. 

She couldn't help but chuckle at the irony. 

"Who knows?"

"Only the royal guard. And Lysippe."

"Keep it that way. If either faction learns the King is..." She didn't finish. Didn't need to.

If Theron or Asterion knew Minos was incapacitated, the civil war would escalate. Both would claim the right to rule in his place. More blood. More chaos.

She decided it was better to maintain the fiction. The King was secure in his chambers, protected by the royal guard, making decisions through his Queen.

Prokles bowed. "Is there anything else, Your Majesty?"

"You are dismissed?"

Prokles withdrew. The door closed softly.

Lysippe looked up from her sorting. "You're ruling Crete now."

"I'm maintaining order. There's a difference."

"Is there?"

The Queen didn't answer. She returned to the window, watching the palace tear itself apart below. Three factions. A mad king. An architect who wouldn't die. A labyrinth that was failing.

And somewhere beneath it all, her son. The Minotaur. Learning. Building. Waiting.

There was a sound from the couch. Both women turned.

Thalia was stirring. Her eyes fluttered open, unfocused, then found the Queen.

"Your Majesty," she whispered.

The Queen crossed the room, knelt beside the couch.

"You're safe now," she said. "Can you tell me what happened?"

Thalia's eyes filled with tears. "He died for me. The architect. He died so I could escape."

"I know." The Queen took her hand gently. "I know. And I need you to tell me everything."

Thalia nodded. Started to speak. And the Queen listened.

To testimony about compassion in darkness. About a man who chose mercy even knowing it would kill him. About a monster that held an experiment, that let her live so it could learn from the architect. Was that still a monster? Or was it becoming something else, entirely?

Outside, the palace fractured further.

Inside, the Queen learned what her curse had become.

And what it might still be saved from.
