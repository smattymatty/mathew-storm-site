# Chapter 1 - The Arrival

The chains had been lighter than expected. They weren't made with lesser iron, Sisyphus could feel the weight in every link, but after an eternity of pushing stone up an endless slope, anything that didn't roll back down felt almost like freedom.

Almost.

His shoulders rolled forward, testing this new absence. Where the boulder's weight had carved grooves in his bones, now only air pressed against him. A different burden entirely. Each step up the stone stairs carried him toward unknown labor, the air sharp with olive groves and sea salt. He only faintly recognized these scents. It had been long since he'd breathed anything but the stale air of Tartarus.

The tower stretched upward, reminding him of his eternal ascent, only this one felt much more cramped. The Guard Captain climbed ahead of him, bronze armor clanking with each step, never once looking back to see if his prisoner followed. Why would he? Where could Sisyphus run that the gods couldn't find him again? As they climbed past arrow slits that framed glimpses of the awakening palace below, Sisyphus understood that this was reassigment, rather than rescue.

"Here." grunted the Guard Captain. He stopped before a heavy wooden door, inserted a small key that scraped against the ancient metal, then pushed. 

The door creaked open, beyond was a workspace that reeked of scholarly madness. Mathematical instruments cluttered every surface, and architectural drawings covered the walls: blueprints for structures that seemed to shift when viewed directly.

Sisyphus stepped inside, taking in the chaos of scrolls and instruments. The floor beneath his feet thrummed subtly, easy to miss if you weren't used to feeling stone. A pulse. Rhythmic. Three beats, pause, two beats. Like a heartbeat counting itself. From deep below.

With focus back to the workshop he had entered, movement caught his eye. In the chamber's center, a man worked hunched over the largest table.

"Daedalus," the Guard Captain said, his voice echoing off the curved stone walls. "Your assistant has arrived."

The hunched figure straightened slowly, then turned with the careful precision of a man who measured every movement. His eyes swept over Sisyphus with calculating intensity, as if already envisioning how this new piece might fit into whatever impossible puzzle he was solving.

"Sisyphus of Corinth," Daedalus said, his cultured voice roughened at the edges.

Sisyphus blinked. He'd assumed his name had faded from mortal memory, yet this man spoke it with casual familiarity. 

Daedalus gestured to the chaos of scrolls, his sleeve brushing against a half-empty wine cup. "Please. Make yourself comfortable." His eyes flicked toward the Guard Captain, then back.

Daedalus's jaw muscles knotted beneath his beard. He swept his trembling hands over the largest scroll. "Welcome, Sisyphus, to your new eternal task."

The architectural plans writhed in the lamplight - corridors that connected to themselves, symbols that shifted when he wasn't looking directly at them. Sisyphus traced a passage with his finger. The ink pulled away from his touch like water from oil, then, when his finger stopped moving, it flowed back. Following the path his finger had just taken. Learning the pattern. Remembering. He jerked his hand away and the ink settled, but now the passage he'd traced was slightly different. As if it had taken notes. His eyes watered trying to follow the new geometry.

"What am I looking at?" Sisyphus asked, his voice steady despite the wrongness of what he saw.

"The perfect prison," Daedalus whispered, his stylus tapping against the table. "A labyrinth of such complexity that even its creators will struggle to navigate it. King Minos has commissioned us to build something that has never existed before."

Sisyphus studied the impossible geometries, his fingers unconsciously tracing the corridors, even still.

"A maze that thinks, that learns, that adapts to its prey." Daedalus's voice dropped lower. "It's meant to contain something that cannot be killed, cannot be reasoned with, and must never be allowed to escape."

He paused, and in the silence Sisyphus could smell the fear-sweat beneath Daedalus's scholarly composure.

"What kind of creature requires a prison like this?" Sisyphus asked.

The Captain's hand drifted to his sword hilt, a subtle warning that some questions were too dangerous to ask directly.

"The kind," Daedalus said carefully, "that learns from every previous encounter. That remembers every failed escape attempt and grows stronger from..."

Daedalus glanced at the Captain as he trailed off.

"Enough," the Captain said flatly, not wanting to learn more than he needed to know. "The King expects progress reports every three days," He paused for a moment; "In fact, he wishes to inspect your progress this very morning. You have until the tenth hour."

He let that sink in before continuing, his voice taking on the flat tone of someone reciting execution orders. "Neither will unauthorized creativity."

"What kind of creativity concerns him?" Sisyphus asked.

The Captain's fingers drummed against his pommel. Three quick taps, pause, two slow. "The kind that makes architects think they're anything more than tools." His voice flattened. "You'll learn."

After the threat hung in the air, Sisyphus nodded. After endless repetition, he knew how threats worked: they revealed the threatener's fears. This one feared creativity. Which meant the system had gaps. The guard had just outlined where to look.

After the Captain's bootfalls had faded down the spiral stairs, Daedalus collapsed into his chair as if invisible puppet strings had been severed. The leather creaked under his weight, releasing the scent of old sweat and older fear.

"Charming fellow," Sisyphus observed, rolling his shoulders to work out the perpetual knots.

"He's executed three architects before us," Daedalus said with forced casualness. "Minos values results over lives."

He reached for his wine cup as the first light of dawn crept through the eastern window, lifting it with desperate hands in what seemed like ritual. The wine was sour, but he drank deeply anyway.

"I once built temples in Athens," he said quietly, staring into the cup. "Places where people came to find hope, to celebrate beauty." His voice carried the weight of loss, his head shook subconsciously. "Now I calculate the most efficient ways for hope to die." He took his final gulp, but the wine couldn't wash away what he'd just admitted. 

The old man collected himself, his scholarly composure returned as his still-trembling hands grabbed the stylus and got back to work.

Sisyphus watched him return to the blueprints, noting how Daedalus's stylus hesitated at certain junctions, as if his hand rebelled against its own precision. At one corner, Daedalus drew what looked like a dead end but was actually—Sisyphus squinted—a shadow passage, barely visible, that might offer moments of concealment. Small mercies disguised as incompetence. Interesting.

The tremor in Daedalus's hands hadn't ceased, and something lurked in his eyes, a depth of self-loathing that Sisyphus recognized like his own reflection.

"What did you do?" Sisyphus asked quietly.

Daedalus's stylus stopped mid-scratch. "What do you mean?"

"To end up here. In this tower, building cages instead of cathedrals." Sisyphus leaned back, the stool groaning beneath him. "Men like us don't fall from grace by stumbling. We make choices that shatter us like-"

"The question," Daedalus interrupted, his voice sharp as a blade drawn from its sheath, "is what you did." The stylus in his fingers went perfectly still - too still. "What manner of crime earns a king eternal servitude to Minos?"

"You want honesty?" Sisyphus asked, rolling his shoulders until the joints cracked. "I angered the gods. Badly enough that Tartarus seemed merciful compared to what they could have done."

Daedalus's stylus stopped mid-stroke. "Which gods?"

"Too many to count." Sisyphus studied his scarred palms. "My punishment was... repetitive. They wanted to teach me patience through endless labor. I think they succeeded, though probably not in the way they intended."

The silence stretched. Daedalus set down his stylus with exaggerated care.

"You must never," Daedalus said, each word precisely enunciated, "speak of divine punishment within these walls. The palace is fanatically devout. Your past stays buried."

"And yours?"

"Mine's staying exactly where I left it." The dismissal was clear.

"Now," Daedalus said, unrolling a different scroll with the brisk efficiency of someone changing an uncomfortable subject, "let me show you the feeding chambers."

The blueprint was smaller but more disturbing. Passages that spiraled inward with mathematical inevitability.

"A whole chamber, for feeding?" Sisyphus asked.

Daedalus's hands began trembling again. "Athens sends... payment. Every seven years. Fourteen." He couldn't quite look at Sisyphus. "The beast must be fed, or it will break free."

"Fourteen what?"

"Does it matter?" Daedalus's voice went cold. "They're dead either way. Our job is to make the system work."

Something tightened in Sisyphus's chest - an old ache he'd thought Tartarus had ground out of him. He said nothing. But his finger, still tracing the feeding chamber passage, had gone still.

Daedalus rolled up the scroll before Sisyphus could study it further. "We have two hours before Minos expects us. Questions about ethics can wait until after we've ensured our own survival."

Sisyphus studied the blueprints with new understanding. A maze that learned from death. He traced one passage with his finger, watching the ink shift. Could it learn from survival too? The thought made him smile slightly—the same smile he'd worn the day he'd chained Death itself. First, he needed to understand what they were building. Then, perhaps, he could discover what else it might become.

The lamp flame guttered in a draft from the window, casting dancing shadows across the walls. In that flickering light, Daedalus's hands moved with practiced efficiency across the feeding chamber blueprints. This was a man who could design hope itself as a weapon.

"The beast," Sisyphus said slowly. "What exactly is it?"

Daedalus's hands began trembling again. "Something that should never have been born." He pulled out a piece of charcoal and began sketching on a scrap of papyrus. "Half bull, half man. The palace calls it the Minotaur—as if naming it could contain what it truly is. When it first arrived, it was just rage and hunger. But each group of tributes teaches it something new."

The charcoal moved across the paper in quick, nervous strokes. "It remembers their tactics, their hiding places. The last group built a barricade. The beast didn't just break through it, it used the pieces to trap them."

For a moment, the sketch revealed something horrifying: not just bull and man fused, but intelligence gleaming in graphite eyes, a mouth curved in what might have been a smile. The thing on the paper seemed to watch them back.

"What happens when it outgrows the maze?" Sisyphus asked.

The charcoal snapped in Daedalus's grip. He stared at the broken pieces for a moment, then swept them into the lamp flame.

"When it breaks free" He stopped. Started again. "If the labyrinth fails, Crete-" Another pause. His hands were shaking worse now. "It won't stop. That's all you need to know. It won't stop."

The sound of boots on stone stairs announced the Guard Captain's return before his scarred face appeared in the doorway. Behind him came two younger guards carrying a wooden tray laden with bread, cheese, watered wine, and olives that gleamed like dark jewels in the morning light.

"Your morning meal," the Captain announced, though his tone suggested this was a chore rather than a courtesy. "Eat quickly. King Minos wishes to inspect your progress before the sun reaches its zenith."

Daedalus's head snapped up, stylus clattering to the table. "Progress? But we've only just-"

"The King," the Captain said with the flat finality of carved stone, "does not concern himself with your timeline. He concerns himself with results." His flint-gray eyes fixed on Daedalus. "Both of you will present yourselves in the throne room at the tenth hour. Come prepared to demonstrate your understanding of the project's requirements."

The guards deposited the tray and filed out, but the Captain lingered in the doorway. His hand rested on his sword hilt as he studied them both with the patient gaze of a predator sizing up prey.

"Don't keep him waiting," he said, then turned and left without another word.

The door closed with the finality of a tomb sealing.

Daedalus stared at the wooden barrier for a long moment, then turned to face Sisyphus with eyes that had gone flat and calculating.

"Three hours," he said, reaching for a piece of bread with hands that had steadied into the focused tremor of a man preparing for surgery. "We have three hours to convince a king who has never been denied anything that two men can accomplish what should take months of planning."

Sisyphus picked up his wine cup, the morning light through the window catching the liquid's surface. "What exactly does he expect to see?"

"Proof that we understand the scope of the project. Evidence that we've grasped not just the architecture, but the... philosophy behind it." Daedalus began spreading out fresh scrolls with quick, economical movements. "Minos doesn't just want a prison. He wants..." Daedalus gestured at the blueprints, searching for words. "Performance art. Each group teaches the next how to die better."

The architect's stylus moved across the papyrus with sudden, urgent precision. "We need to show him modifications - improvements to contain a beast that's grown stronger since the last tribute. New chambers to replace the ones it destroyed during its last frenzy. Passages that account for its learning, its adaptation."

As Daedalus worked, Sisyphus found himself studying the man's profile. The desperate energy in his movements wasn't mere professional pride - it was the frantic calculation of a man balancing invisible weights. Each line he drew seemed to cost him something irreplaceable.

"Why are you here, Daedalus?" Sisyphus asked quietly. "Really? What hold does Minos have over you?"

Daedalus's stylus stopped. His free hand moved to his chest, an unconscious gesture, fingers pressing against something small and hard beneath his tunic. A shape. Circular. He caught himself, dropped his hand like he'd touched fire. "The same hold he has on everyone." His voice was carefully empty. "We all have something we can't afford to lose." Another clear dismissal.

Sisyphus reached for the bread, noting how the liquid in his cup trembled with each distant vibration through the stone, rhythmic and wrong, like a pulse through veins that shouldn't exist. Three beats, pause, two beats. The same pattern as the Captain's fingers on his pommel. The same pattern as the floor's vibration when he'd entered. The fortress itself was becoming alive, learning to breathe in harmony with the thing it held.

In three hours, they would face a king who treated human lives like architectural materials. Below their feet, something born from divine cruelty was learning to be crueler still.

Sisyphus flexed his hands. The boulder had left calluses, grooves worn into bone, scars that marked ten thousand years of repetition. That work had been simple. Push. Fall. Start over.

This work taught something that learned. That remembered. That would outlive him and everyone who came after.

The boulder only broke him. But this? This would break everything else.
