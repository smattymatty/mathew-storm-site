# Chapter 10 - The Underworld Rejection

Sisyphus opened his eyes.

Grey sky. Grey water. Grey shore stretching in both directions forever.

"Oh, for fuck's sake."

He sat up. No pain. No broken ribs. No crushed lungs. Just the dull, familiar ache of being dead again.

The River Styx lapped at his feet with the enthusiasm of a municipal drainage ditch. Same grey water. Same grey ferryman poling his way across with the speed of someone who'd given up on punctuality ten thousand years ago.

Charon's boat scraped onto the shore with a sound like someone giving up. The ferryman looked at Sisyphus. Looked at his manifest. Looked at Sisyphus again.

"No," Charon said.

"What?"

"You're not supposed to be here."

"And yet." Sisyphus gestured at the grey landscape. "Here I am."

Charon consulted his scroll with the weary professionalism of someone who'd been doing customer service since the dawn of time. His bony finger traced down lines of names. Stopped. Traced back up. Stopped again.

"Your file says ETERNAL LABOR IN PROGRESS." He looked up. "Still in progress. Present tense. You can't be dead if you're still being punished."

"I was killed. Legitimately. By the Minotaur." Sisyphus crossed his arms. "I was crushed, it was very thorough. I felt my ribs break, and everything!"

"Yes, but-" Charon tapped the manifest. "-you died during the punishment. That's... complicated."

"How is being murdered complicated?"

"Because eternal labor means you're not supposed to die. Eternal. That's the point." The ferryman's skull somehow managed to look pained. "If you died, you either escaped the punishment - which you can't do - or you're still being punished - which means you're not dead."

Sisyphus stared at him.

Charon stared back.

"Get in the boat," Charon said finally. "This is above my pay grade."

---

The ferry ride was uncomfortable.

Not because of the grey water or the distant wailing of souls or the fact that Sisyphus was technically still supposed to be pushing a boulder somewhere. But because Charon kept muttering to himself while poling, occasionally shooting Sisyphus looks that managed to convey accusation despite having no face.

"Three thousand years," Charon muttered. "Three thousand years of smooth operations. No problems. Then you."

"To be fair, I didn't ask to be crushed to death." Sisyphus defended.

"You never ask. That's the problem." Another accusatory look. "Do you know how many forms I had to file after your last stunt? The Persephone incident?"

"I returned voluntarily."

"After a DECADE. With compound interest on the ferry toll." Charon's pole hit water with more force than necessary. "Do you know what compound interest looks like over ten years in the underworld?"

They crossed in silence after that. The far shore materialized from grey mist; not Tartarus, where Sisyphus's boulder waited in eternal futility, but somewhere else. A complex of buildings that looked like they'd been designed by someone who'd given up on architecture and settled for "depressingly functional."

"Processing," Charon announced. "Fourth door on the left. Ask for Minos."

"Minos?" Sisyphus felt shock from hearing the name down here.

"Different Minos. Underworld bureaucrat. He handles complicated cases." Charon gestured with his pole. "Go. And try not to break anything else."

Sisyphus stepped onto the shore. Behind him, Charon was already poling away, muttering about filing extensions and administrative overhead.

The building loomed. Grey stone. Grey doors. A sign above the entrance read: DEPARTMENT OF ETERNAL PUNISHMENT - PROCESSING & APPEALS.

Sisyphus pushed through the fourth door on the left.

---

The office could have been any government building in any city that had ever existed. Rows of desks staffed by shades filing paperwork. The scratch of styluses on wax tablets. The shuffle of scrolls being moved from one pile to another. The ambient despair of bureaucracy made eternal.

A clerk looked up. "Number?"

"I don't have a number."

"Then you can't be processed."

"Charon sent me. Said to ask for Minos."

The clerk's expression - as far as a translucent shade had expressions - shifted to something like pity. "Ah. You're one of those cases." He gestured to a desk in the back corner. "That Minos. Good luck."

Minos the bureaucrat was a thin shade with ink-stained fingers and the look of someone who'd died of exhaustion somewhere around the Trojan War and never fully recovered. He was surrounded by stacks of tablets, scrolls, and papyrus that threatened to collapse at any moment.

"Name," he said without looking up.

"Sisyphus of Corinth."

Minos's stylus stopped mid-scratch. He looked up slowly.

"Oh no."

"So you know me."

"Everyone here knows you." Minos began shuffling through tablets with increasing desperation. "You're the ETERNAL LABOR case. Active punishment. Ongoing. Present tense. You're not supposed to be here. You're supposed to be-" He found a tablet, read it, looked at Sisyphus. "-pushing a boulder up a hill. Right now. Forever."

"I was. Then I got reassigned to the labyrinth project in Crete. Then I got condmned to death. Then the Minotaur killed me. Now I'm here."

Minos stared at him for a long moment. Then reached for a different stack of tablets. "The labyrinth project. That's... that's the Minos file. King Minos. Different department." He found the tablet. "Says here you were loaned to the mortal realm for architectural consultation. Temporary assignment, term undefined."

"I completed the assignment by dying."

"That's not how temporary assignments work. You can't complete an eternal punishment. That's definitional." Minos set down the tablet. "Let me get my supervisor."

He disappeared through a doorway. Sisyphus waited, watching other shades process their paperwork with the mechanical efficiency of people who'd given up on hoping for anything better.

Minos returned with another shade - older, more translucent, carrying even more paperwork.

"This is Rhadamanthys," Minos said. "He handles edge cases."

Rhadamanthys examined Sisyphus with the weary expertise of someone who'd judged souls since before Crete was founded. "Sisyphus. The chainer of Death. The escaper of punishment. The..." He consulted a tablet. "...architectural consultant?"

"It's been a complicated afterlife."

"Death during divine punishment," Rhadamanthys read. "Is that still punishment or is that escape?" He looked at Minos. "Thoughts?"

"The punishment was labor, not death. Death would mean escape."

"But he died during the labor. So technically-"

"You can't technically complete eternal labor. That defeats the purpose."

"Unless the death itself was part of the labor?" Rhadamanthys suggested. "Making his death... also punishment?"

They both looked at Sisyphus.

"I helped someone escape the labyrinth," Sisyphus offered. "Then got killed for it. Does that negate divine punishment or fulfill it?"

Both bureaucrats went very still.

"We need to consult Hades," they said in unison.

---

They didn't walk to see Hades. They filed a request.

Sisyphus watched as Minos filled out a form in triplicate, stamped it with three different seals, attached supporting documentation, and handed it to a messenger shade who disappeared through a doorway marked DIVINE CONSULTATION.

"How long does this usually take?" Sisyphus asked.

"Depends on his mood," Rhadamanthys said. "Sometimes immediate. Sometimes never. He's very busy."

They waited.

Sisyphus sat on a bench that had been worn smooth by countless dead souls awaiting judgment. Around him, the bureaucracy of death ground on with inexorable efficiency. A shade argued with a clerk about whether drowning counted as "death by water" or "death by lung failure" for categorization purposes. Another filled out form after form, each one generating three more forms in response.

After what might have been ten minutes or ten hours - time behaved strangely here - the chamber grew cold. Not temperature. Something deeper. The kind of cold that preceded existence itself.

A presence filled the space. Not voice. Understanding. Direct and absolute.

"The punishment continues. He returns to flesh."

Everyone stopped working. Even the eternal bureaucracy paused before that absolute indifference.

Minos looked up from his tablets, voice trembling. "Back to... back to the boulder, Lord Hades?"

"To wherever he fell. The logic breaks otherwise. We do not accommodate paradox."

Rhadamanthys and Minos exchanged glances.

"So..." Minos said carefully. "We're rejecting his death?"

The cold presence pressed against the chamber walls. Not anger. Indifference with weight.

"Yes."

"On what grounds?"

"Too complicated, not worth the administrative overhead."

Sisyphus started laughing.

Both bureaucrats looked at him.

"I'm sorry," Sisyphus managed between laughs. "I'm being rejected by death itself because I'm too much paperwork?"

"Essentially, yes," Rhadamanthys said. "You're an edge case that breaks our filing system. If we process you as dead, we negate your eternal punishment. If we send you back to the boulder, we ignore your legitimate death. If we keep you here in processing, you're technically escaping punishment by existing in administrative limbo."

"So nobody wants to deal with it."

"Correct." Minos pulled out a different form. "We're issuing you a RETURN TO SENDER classification. You'll be ejected back to the mortal realm near the point of death. Whatever happens after that is not our jurisdiction."

"You're passing me back to King Minos?"

"We're passing you back to physical reality and letting it sort itself out." Rhadamanthys began stamping forms. "Frankly, this is a relief. Your file was giving me a headache."

"I didn't know shades could get headaches."

"We don't. That's how bad your file is."

The forms were stamped, filed, and disappeared into slots in the wall. Immediately, Sisyphus felt something change. The grey world started feeling less solid. His body - dead body? Living body? - began to lighten.

"Wait," he said. "What happens when I go back? I'm still dead. The Minotaur crushed me."

"Not our problem," Minos said cheerfully. "You wanted to die properly? File an appeal in triplicate and wait for a response. Otherwise, you're going back."

"But I-"

The floor vanished.

Sisyphus fell upward - or downward, or sideways, directions lost meaning. The grey world of the underworld dissolved like smoke. He was being pulled, yanked, ejected from death itself with all the ceremony of someone being thrown out of a tavern for causing trouble.

The last thing he heard was Charon's distant voice drifting across the Styx:

"Knew he'd be back eventually. Didn't think it would be this fast. Do I file a refund for the ferry toll or...?"

Then darkness.

Then sky.

Blue sky. Actual color. The shock of it after the underworld's grey nearly blinded him.

Sisyphus had half a second to register he was several hundred feet above Crete, falling, before gravity remembered it had a job to do.

The palace sprawled below him, getting closer fast. Courtyard. Rooftops. The distant figures of guards who definitely weren't expecting a dead man to drop from the heavens.

"Oh," he said to the rushing wind. "This is going to be complicated to explain."

Then he fell.
