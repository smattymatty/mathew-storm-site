The throne room of King Minos stretched before them, painted columns rising into shadow. Their escort's boots echoed against polished stone. Daedalus's stomach clenched with each step.

Beside him, Sisyphus walked with unnerving steadiness, as if approaching thrones was merely another form of repetitive labor. The man's calm made Daedalus's own terror more acute. In his arms, the leather portfolio grew heavier. Three hours of desperate creativity that would either satisfy the monster who ruled Crete or provide fresh entertainment through their deaths.

*Icarus would be fourteen now*. The thought struck without warning, as it always did in moments of stress. *Old enough to appreciate architectural beauty, young enough to still believe his father still creates wonders*. Daedalus's hand moved unconsciously to his chest, where he kept a small bronze compass Icarus had made, its weight both a comfort and torment.

The throne itself sat on a raised plate at the chamber's far end, carved from a single block of black marble. Upon it sat Minos, motionless as the stone itself but infinitely more dangerous. He didn't acknowledge their approach, his attention fixed on a scroll that Daedalus recognized with sinking certainty—reports from Athens, perhaps, or intelligence about tribute preparations. The silence stretched until Daedalus's hands began their telltale tremor.

"Your Majesty," Daedalus forced out, willing his voice to steadiness his hands couldn't achieve, "we bring initial modifications to the labyrinth design, accounting for the recent... developments."

Minos raised his head with the deliberate slowness. Those dark eyes fixed first on him with familiar contempt, then shifted to Sisyphus with the calculating assessment of someone evaluating a new blade's sharpness.

"Show me," the King commanded.

Daedalus unrolled their drawings, muscle memory taking over where courage failed. The modifications they'd sketched were good work—he knew this with the part of his mind that remained objective about craft even as the rest of him screamed. Reinforced chambers where the beast had broken through. New passage configurations that accounted for its growing intelligence. Adaptive sections that could evolve with their prisoner.

"The beast has grown stronger since the last tribute," Daedalus explained, his stylus moving with the precision that had once built temples. "These modifications account for its increased size and intelligence. The walls must be thicker here, the passages more complex there. And these chambers—" He indicated the interconnected spaces he'd designed with bitter expertise. "—allow for systematic testing of the maze's effectiveness."

He watched Minos study the plans with an absorption that reminded Daedalus of his own focus when solving architectural problems. The King's fingers traced certain passages while ignoring others, and Daedalus felt a sick recognition—Minos didn't just want functional cruelty; he wanted elegant cruelty. Artful suffering. The kind Daedalus had become expert at providing.

"This section," Minos said, tapping a confluence of passages near the labyrinth's heart. "Too straightforward. A clever tribute might navigate it too quickly." He looked at Sisyphus. "What would you do to... complicate matters?"

Sisyphus studied the junction. Daedalus held his breath - if he suggested anything merciful, anything weak-

"I don't know yet," Sisyphus said. "I'd need to see how the stone moves in that configuration. Whether the angles create natural confusion or require artificial-"

"I didn't ask for a lecture on methodology." Minos's voice went flat. "I asked what you would do."

Daedalus felt sweat prickle his scalp. This was the test. Minos didn't tolerate uncertainty.

"Build a false exit," Sisyphus said finally. "Right here. Let them think they've solved it. Then when they step through-" He traced a line with his finger. "-the passage loops back to the feeding chamber. Their own hope delivers them."

The silence stretched. Minos's fingers drummed once against the marble armrest.

"Adequate," he said, setting down the scroll. "You'll refine it during construction. I expect improvements."

Adequate wasn't approval. It was provisional survival.

The King rose from his throne with the fluid grace of a predator sated but not satisfied. "Work begins immediately. I want to see structural progress by week's end, and full implementation of these modifications within the month." His gaze shifted between them like a blade testing edges. "Failure to meet these deadlines will result in... personal testing of the labyrinth's effectiveness."

As guards escorted them from the throne room, Sisyphus walked beside him in contemplative silence, his gaze fixed on something distant. Daedalus wanted to warn him that it only got worse, that each compromise carved away another piece of whatever soul remained. But what was the point? They would both learn soon enough that some prisons were built from the inside out, bar by bar, choice by terrible choice.

The weight of the portfolio in his arms felt heavier now, filled with future horrors he would design with the same precision he'd once used for beauty. Perdix would have figured out another - no. He crushed that thought before it could form completely. The memory of his nephew's eyes, wide with surprise as he fell, threatened to surface. Daedalus forced it down with practiced efficiency. Some guilts were too dangerous to examine in daylight.

Everyone serves something, he'd told Sisyphus. His hand found the compass in his pocket again. Icarus had been so proud making it, the bronze still rough where his small fingers hadn't quite smoothed the edges. Daedalus tightened his grip until the metal bit into his palm.

The palace corridors seemed to multiply as they walked, each turn revealing another passage decorated with frescoes of bulls and dolphins. The guards ahead moved with practiced efficiency—one young, one old.

"The King seemed... pleased," Daedalus ventured quietly.

"Did he?" Sisyphus replied. "I thought he seemed hungry."

The younger guard glanced back. His companion's hand clamped on his shoulder.

"Eyes front, Alexios. What you hear in these halls stays in these halls."

"But Lieutenant Theron said we should-"

"Lieutenant Theron isn't here."

Daedalus noted the name. Another layer of palace politics. The boy fell silent, though his shoulders stayed tense with unspoken questions.

They emerged into sunlight where horses waited. Sergeant Nikias announced, "We ride for the quarries. His Majesty expects you there before sunset."

The path climbed through olive groves into bare mountain. Daedalus's fingers found the compass in his pocket as Sisyphus rode alongside.

"Tell me about these quarries," Sisyphus said.

"Three years at this scale. The labyrinth requires materials that exist in flexible relationships with physical law."

They passed workers hauling stone that moved too easily for its mass.

"The stone learns," Sisyphus observed quietly.

The same intuitive leap Perdix had made. Daedalus's knuckles whitened on the reins.

When they crested the ridge, the excavation sprawled below: stone cut at angles that shouldn't exist, workers moving in patterns that hurt to track.

"Welcome," Daedalus said quietly, "to where we make the impossible possible."

---

The construction site sprawled below them like an open wound in the earth, revealing layer upon layer of ancient stone and newer excavation. Workers moved in practiced patterns, chisel percussion echoing against stone, shadows falling at angles that contradicted the sun's position.

"Surface architecture is merely decoration," Daedalus explained, leading the way down. "The real labyrinth exists below."

"How deep?" Sisyphus asked, watching workers lower a massive block into darkness.

"Seven levels confirmed. Possibly more." Daedalus kept his voice neutral.

They approached the stone masons working on a cornerstone that curved while maintaining sharp edges - a mathematical impossibility rendered in limestone. Sisyphus stopped short.

"How does this connect to conventional masonry?"

Keras, one of the senior masons, looked up before Daedalus could answer. A scar ran from his left eye to his jaw, white against weathered skin. "It don't, sir. Master Daedalus gives us drawings, but the measurements change depending on how you look at 'em."

"The specifications follow precise non-Euclidean principles," Daedalus interjected.

Sisyphus knelt beside the cornerstone, hands tracing the impossible edge where the curve maintained its angle. His fingers followed the geometry once, twice, three times—the same motion repeated with minute variations in pressure and speed.

"It don't work like that," Keras said. "You can't force it to make sense. You gotta let it show you."

"Everything makes sense," Sisyphus murmured, still tracing. "You just have to try enough times."

On his seventh pass, his hand jerked back. The stone had shifted—microscopically, but shifted. He tried again. Same spot, same motion. Nothing. Adjusted his angle slightly. The stone stayed inert. Again. Again. By the twentieth attempt, sweat beaded his forehead.

"Master Daedalus spent three weeks on his first one," Keras offered.

Sisyphus didn't respond, just kept trying. Fortieth attempt. Fiftieth. His fingers began bleeding where the edge cut him. Noon sun beat down. Other workers broke for water.

Sisyphus kept going.

On the hundred-and-third attempt, the stone cooperated. Just a fraction. But enough.

Daedalus watched from the shade, his mouth dry. This was how Perdix had worked; not through genius but through relentless, patient iteration that made genius irrelevant. The same motion performed until the universe surrendered.

---

By sunset, Sisyphus had set three stones. What had taken Daedalus weeks.

"Tomorrow I'll be faster," Sisyphus said, wrapping his bleeding hands.

"Enough surface work," Daedalus announced. "Time you saw where your efforts lead."

The entrance to the depths was concealed behind solid stone—until Daedalus pressed his palm against a specific point and the rock face split along seams that hadn't existed moments before. Beyond lay a platform suspended over darkness.

"My design," Daedalus said. "A lifting platform that operates on counterweights. The stone knows which direction it needs to go."

They stepped onto the platform - Daedalus, Sisyphus, and the two guards. Alexios gripped the rail. Nikias stood steady.

Down they went, past layers of construction that chronicled the project's evolution. Conventional masonry gave way to architecture that challenged perception. Then deeper, into darkness where lamplight struggled.

The air changed. Not cooler as it should be going underground, but warmer. Body-temperature. Like descending into something living. The torch smoke pooled against the ceiling, spreading horizontally before dripping down the walls like oil.

The platform shuddered. In the silence, they could all hear it - rhythmic breathing too deep, too vast for any natural throat.

"Testing ground," Daedalus announced when they stopped. "Every modification verified before implementation."

His voice came out strange when he tried to speak, the chamber swallowed some syllables, amplified others. "Testing-" echoed seven times. "-ground" didn't echo at all. Sound itself didn't know how to behave here.

The chamber that opened before them defied description. Vast enough to hold temples, yet its walls curved in patterns that made measurement impossible. 

Sisyphus took three steps forward and his balance failed. Rather than stumbling, his inner ear screamed. Down was now thirty degrees to the left. He locked his knees, forced his eyes to follow the floor. The floor was level. His body insisted it was tilted. The disagreement made his stomach clench.

Alexios reached for the wall to steady himself. His hand passed through where the wall LOOKED solid, found stone three inches further in. He jerked back, examining his fingers: no injury, but his hand hit something that his eyes said wasn't there. "It's not... the wall isn't where it..." He couldn't finish.

"Paths that promise freedom but guarantee deeper imprisonment," Daedalus said, the words worn smooth from repetition. "Chambers that offer sanctuary but become traps."

He'd given this speech to three previous assistants. Two had fled. One had thrown himself from the platform during the return ascent.

Sisyphus merely nodded.

The sound came again - closer. A rumbling howl that vibrated through stone and bone. Intelligence lived in that sound, and hunger, and something worse: patience.

"Each feeding teaches it something new," Daedalus said.

"And we're teaching it too." Sisyphus picked up a piece of impossible stone. "Every refinement, every improvement, we're showing it exactly how we think."

Ice spread through Daedalus's chest. He'd had the same thought countless times, but hearing it spoken made it real.

"The question," Sisyphus continued, examining the stone as it shifted weight in his hands, "is what we choose to teach it."

The guards shifted nervously. Alexios's gripped his spear tighter.

"What do you mean?" Daedalus heard himself ask.

"The stone learns. We decide its lessons."

Another sound rose from below. Not a howl. The breathing changed - three long, two short. Responding. Answering. The intelligence in that reversal made Nikias's hand tighten on his spear. This wasn't mere instinct.

Daedalus shivered. The beast was listening.

And Sisyphus was suggesting they could teach it lessons Minos never intended.

The chamber echoed with the sound of stone being shaped by immortal hands. Below, something listened to every strike of the chisel. In the darkness, it was learning.
