<h1 id="chapter-3-the-watchers-warning">Chapter 3: The Watcher's Warning</h1>
<p>Prometheus had learned to watch from the edges of things.</p>
<p>The morning war council gathered around Metis's map. Zeus at the head, Poseidon and Hades flanking, Hera mediating. The usual chaos of desperate gods trying to win an unwinnable war.</p>
<p>Except.</p>
<p>Metis stood beside Zeus, showing supply routes. Their hands didn't touch, but moved in parallel. Synchronized. When Zeus leaned forward to study a junction, Metis shifted her weight to give him better angle. When she asked a question, he answered without the defensiveness he showed everyone else.</p>
<p>"Here," Zeus said, tracing a path. "If we position-"</p>
<p>"They'll be exposed," Metis finished. "Unless we stagger the timing."</p>
<p>Hera caught Prometheus's eye. Raised an eyebrow. Seeing it too.</p>
<p>But Zeus didn't see what his hand was doing: resting on the arm of his chair. Not gripping. Just... claiming. The unconscious gesture of ownership.</p>
<p>Metis explained refugee routes. Zeus nodded, absorbed. His fingers drummed against the armrest. Tap tap tap. Possessive rhythm.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow we flood the valley," Metis said. "Show them terror isn't the only way."</p>
<p>"Together," Zeus agreed.</p>
<p>The word hung there. Two meanings in one sound.</p>
<p>Metis heard: partnership.<br />
Zeus meant: king and valued advisor.</p>
<p>Prometheus saw the gap between.</p>
<p>After the meeting broke, Zeus stayed behind. Studying Metis's map like it held secrets. His hand moved again—that gesture. Reaching toward something that wasn't there yet.</p>
<p>Prometheus remembered Chronos at that age. Same hunger. Same certainty he'd be different.</p>
<p>"She's remarkable, isn't she?"</p>
<p>Zeus jerked, hadn't heard him approach. "Effective."</p>
<p>"More than that." Prometheus moved to stand beside him. "Different from anyone here."</p>
<p>Zeus studied the map. "She sees patterns. Consequences. Things we miss."</p>
<p>"And after? When Chronos falls?"</p>
<p>"We build something better. Together."</p>
<p>There—that pause before 'together.' Microsecond hesitation.</p>
<p>"Will you share the throne?"</p>
<p>Zeus laughed. "There shouldn't BE a throne. We'll have a council. No more tyrants."</p>
<p>"Your father said that too. Once."</p>
<p>Zeus's expression flickered. Anger, fear, denial. "I'm not my father."</p>
<p>"Not yet," Prometheus said quietly.</p>
<p>The words hit. Zeus's hand tightened on the chair. "You think I'll become him?"</p>
<p>"I think thrones change people. Power reveals what was hidden."</p>
<p>"Then I'll prove you wrong." Zeus met his eyes. "With her counsel, I'll be different."</p>
<p>Prometheus looked at the chair where Zeus's hand rested. The claiming gesture Zeus didn't know he was making.</p>
<p>"I hope so," he said. Didn't believe it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Prometheus descended alone as evening fell.</p>
<p>The cave entrance opened like a mouth. Inside: the Fates at their loom, weaving reality itself.</p>
<p>They didn't look up, they knew he was coming.</p>
<p>"The Titan who sees ahead," Clotho said, threading, "comes to see further ahead."</p>
<p>"I need to know. About Zeus and Metis."</p>
<p>Lachesis looked up from her weaving. "Need to KNOW? Or need to HEAR?"</p>
<p>"There's a difference," Atropos added, scissors gleaming. "Knowing changes nothing. Hearing makes you complicit."</p>
<p>Prometheus hesitated. Then: "Tell me."</p>
<p>Clotho held up two threads: gold and silver, intertwining. Beautiful pattern forming as Lachesis wove them together.</p>
<p>"When?" Prometheus asked.</p>
<p>"When power fears love more than it loves power."</p>
<p>"Can I stop it?"</p>
<p>"You can watch." Lachesis's fingers never stopped moving. "That's your gift. And your curse."</p>
<p>"There must be something-"</p>
<p>Atropos raised her scissors. Held them above the pattern.</p>
<p>"Wait-"</p>
<p>She cut.</p>
<p>The golden thread remained. The silver scattered into fragments: not destroyed, but distributed. Infinite pieces spreading across the loom.</p>
<p>"The king survives," Atropos said. "Wisdom... transforms."</p>
<p>They showed him more:</p>
<p>A throne room. Zeus alone. Dead flowers everywhere.</p>
<p>Silver light scattered across the world. Everywhere and nowhere.</p>
<p>An eagle. A rock. Chains. Liver growing back forever.</p>
<p>Prometheus understood the last one. "Because I'll try to help her."</p>
<p>"Because you'll try to help THEM," the Fates said together. "Both of them. Love makes fools of the wise."</p>
<p>"Then I won't help. I'll warn them. Tell them what's coming."</p>
<p>The Fates looked at him with infinite pity.</p>
<p>"And Zeus will thank you for the warning?" Clotho asked. "Will trust you more?"</p>
<p>"And Metis will abandon her mission?" Lachesis continued. "Stop planting seeds?"</p>
<p>"Or will they both resent you," Atropos finished, "for suggesting their love is doomed?"</p>
<p>Prometheus saw it: telling Zeus would make the prophecy come true faster. Telling Metis would break her hope. Telling both would change nothing except making him the enemy.</p>
<p>"Now you understand." The Fates returned to their weaving. "You can watch. You can witness. You can remember. But you cannot prevent."</p>
<p>"So I do nothing?"</p>
<p>"You do what love requires: bear witness to tragedy. Hold space for their choices. And when the scattering comes-" Atropos touched the silver fragments on the loom. "-you remember what wisdom looked like whole."</p>
<p>Prometheus climbed back toward the surface. The weight of knowledge pressed down with each step.</p>
<p>He knew. Couldn't un-know. Couldn't act on knowing.</p>
<p>The perfect trap.</p>
<hr />
<p>Prometheus found Metis in the grove, studying stars.</p>
<p>She looked up, smiled. "Couldn't sleep either?"</p>
<p>"Thinking about tomorrow."</p>
<p>"We'll win." She patted the ground beside her. "Come. Help me with these calculations."</p>
<p>He sat. Watched her work. The certainty in her movements. The hope.</p>
<p>"You really believe he'll listen," Prometheus said. "That he'll choose wisdom over power."</p>
<p>"I have to." She traced constellation patterns. "Otherwise what's the point?"</p>
<p>"What if power consumes wisdom instead?"</p>
<p>She laughed. Dismissed it. "Zeus isn't like that. He listens. He values counsel."</p>
<p>"Everyone's different," Prometheus said, "until they're not."</p>
<p>She touched his arm. "I know you worry. But trust me. Trust him. We're going to build something beautiful."</p>
<p>He looked at her: so certain, so hopeful. Wanted to tell her about the Fates. About scissors and scattered silver and thrones that poison.</p>
<p>But she wouldn't believe him. Would think he was jealous, or afraid, or trying to undermine her work.</p>
<p>"I do trust you," he lied. "Both of you."</p>
<p>After she returned to her tent, Prometheus remained under stars.</p>
<p>Could tell her: she wouldn't listen.<br />
Could tell Zeus: he'd hate him for it.<br />
Could tell both: would make it worse.</p>
<p>The Fates showed him chains. That was the price of helping.</p>
<p>But what was the price of staying silent?</p>
<p>He thought of the vision: silver light scattered. Infinite fragments. Not destroyed, but transformed. Wisdom scattered becoming wisdom everywhere.</p>
<p>Maybe... maybe the tragedy served something larger. Maybe her consumption created something her preservation couldn't.</p>
<p>He hated himself for thinking it. For already learning to justify cruelty as necessity.</p>
<p>Maybe that's what happened when you saw the future: you became complicit in it.</p>
<p>Prometheus made his choice.</p>
<p>He would watch. Bear witness. Remember.</p>
<p>When Zeus reached for the throne, Prometheus would see it.<br />
When Metis offered mercy, he would see it.<br />
When the consumption came, he would see it.</p>
<p>And after, when wisdom scattered, he would remember what she'd tried to build.</p>
<p>Someone had to.</p>
<p>Love made you blind to what you feared most to see.<br />
Foresight made you see what you were powerless to prevent.</p>
<p>He had both. The perfect curse.</p>
