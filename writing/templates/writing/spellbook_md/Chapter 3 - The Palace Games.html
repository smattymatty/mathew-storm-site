<h1 id="chapter-3-the-palace-games">Chapter 3 - The Palace Games</h1>
<p>Queen Pasiphaë watched from her chamber window as they erected the scaffold in the courtyard below. The carpenter worked quickly - he'd done this before. Too many times before.</p>
<p>She counted the supply wagons at the distant quarry. Only eleven today, down from seventeen the week before.</p>
<p>Her palm pressed against the cool stone. The vibrations traveled up from below - not settling, not construction. Breathing. The same rhythm that had once moved inside her. Her body remembered what her mind refused.</p>
<p>Behind her, the door opened without announcement.</p>
<p>"Majesty." Lieutenant Theron's voice carried respect that sounded like mockery. "The execution is scheduled for the tenth hour."</p>
<p>She didn't turn. "On whose authority?"</p>
<p>"The King's standing orders regarding desertion." His footsteps crossed her chamber uninvited. "Any attempt to flee the island constitutes treason. The harbor master made his choice."</p>
<p>"Minos didn't authorize this specific-"</p>
<p>"The King is indisposed. As you well know." Theron picked up one of her letters from the writing desk without permission. "Correspondence from Rhodes? Their governor seeks extensions. Syracuse makes similar requests. Everyone senses weakness, Majesty."</p>
<p>She turned to face him. He stood reading her private letters as if they were his own.</p>
<p>Her hand twitched toward the bronze letter opener on her desk, from years of imagining what freedom might cost. She forced her fingers to stillness.</p>
<p>"The harbor master has a family," she said evenly.</p>
<p>"Had a family. They boarded a ship for Athens three nights ago. He was to follow yesterday." Theron set down the letter. "One of my men was waiting at the dock."</p>
<p>"You're executing a man for trying to leave?"</p>
<p>"I'm executing a traitor for desertion during crisis. There's a difference." He moved toward the window, standing too close. "Unless Your Majesty believes fleeing one's post is acceptable? That would send an interesting message."</p>
<p>The trap was elegant. Defend the harbor master and she admitted the crisis. Condemn him and she enabled Theron's tyranny.</p>
<p>Before she could respond, Lysippe appeared in the doorway. "Your Majesty, the council-"</p>
<p>Theron moved toward her, forcing Lysippe to step back. "Tell me, what do the servants say about today's execution?"</p>
<p>Lysippe's eyes flicked to the Queen. "They say... they say it's meant as warning."</p>
<p>"Precisely." Theron smiled. "Three kitchen staff fled two nights ago. The stable master's family departed yesterday. Even our good Commander Asterion has been making quiet inquiries about his pension." He circled back to the Queen. "Today's execution reminds everyone that loyalty isn't optional."</p>
<p>"You exceed your authority," Pasiphaë said.</p>
<p>"Do I? The King gave standing orders. I merely enforce them." He paused at the door. "Unless Your Majesty wishes to countermand his orders? I'm certain he'd be fascinated to learn you're protecting deserters. He's been so... reasonable lately."</p>
<p>They both knew what Minos had become. To contradict Theron meant facing the King's paranoid fury.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty should attend," Theron continued. "Your absence would be noticed. Whispered about. Some might think the crown itself has lost faith in Cretan justice."</p>
<p>After he left, Lysippe's composure crumbled. "He's using the execution to trap everyone. Attend and you endorse it. Refuse and-"</p>
<p>"And he questions my loyalty to the King." Pasiphaë moved back to the window. The scaffold was nearly complete. "Tell me what the servants really say."</p>
<p>"They say the King hasn't slept in weeks. That he visits the lower chambers alone, emerging with blood on his robes. They say Daedalus looks haunted but the foreign architect just... continues. Works without rest, without fear. They say he's not natural." Lysippe paused. "And they say anyone who asks questions ends up missing. Like Thalia."</p>
<p>The scullery maid. Everyone knew where she'd gone. No one said it aloud.</p>
<p>"They're executing the harbor master to keep the rest of us here," Pasiphaë said quietly. "Theron knows we're all planning to run. This is him closing the doors."</p>
<p>"Then what do we do?"</p>
<p>Pasiphaë watched the scaffold take shape. By the tenth hour, a man would die to prove a point: that no one leaves Crete. That loyalty is mandatory. That they were all trapped on this island with whatever breathed below.</p>
<p>"Double the guard on my chambers," she said. "And prepare food for travel."</p>
<p>"But the execution - if Theron is watching everyone-"</p>
<p>"He can't watch forever." Pasiphaë's reflection in the glass showed perfect composure, but her hand trembled against the stone. "I won't be here when the servants learn we've been feeding them to a monster."</p>
<hr />
<p>The balcony overlooked the courtyard where </p>
<p>"His Majesty sends his regrets." Lieutenant Theron stood at the balcony railing, arms crossed. "Affairs of state require his attention below."</p>
<p>The three council members stood in uneasy silence. Commander Asterion kept his eyes fixed on the horizon. Kleomenes gripped the railing, ink-stained fingers leaving prints on stone. The High Priest's prayer beads clicked in rhythm with his muttered recitations.</p>
<p>Below, guards brought out the harbor master. His hands were bound, but he walked steadily. No hood covered his face - Theron wanted everyone to see.</p>
<p>"This is unnecessary," Polyidus said quietly. "The man sought only to-"</p>
<p>"To abandon his post during crisis." Theron moved to stand beside the priest. "To betray his oaths. To flee like a coward."</p>
<p>"His family had already left. A man seeking to reunite with-"</p>
<p>"A man abandoning Crete." Theron's voice hardened. "Tell me, Holy One, what do the scriptures say about duty? About loyalty to one's kingdom?"</p>
<p>Polyidus's jaw tightened. "They also speak of mercy. Of compassion for-"</p>
<p>"For the faithful, yes. Not for deserters." Theron gestured to the courtyard below where workers had gathered; a forced attendance. "These men remain. They do their duty despite fear, despite hardship. What message does pardoning a deserter send them?"</p>
<p>"That we are not savages," Polyidus said. "That Crete still values-"</p>
<p>"Crete values loyalty." Theron turned to face him fully. "Unless you believe desertion should be rewarded? I'm certain His Majesty would be interested in your theological interpretation."</p>
<p>Polyidus opened his mouth, then closed it.</p>
<p>"I thought so." Theron looked to Asterion. "Commander? Any military objections to this proceeding?"</p>
<p>Asterion's face remained impassive. His nephew's shipping contracts with Athens sat on Theron's desk; proof enough for execution if Theron chose to use it.</p>
<p>"None," Asterion said flatly.</p>
<p>"Kleomenes? As treasurer, perhaps you have economic concerns about losing a harbor master?"</p>
<p>Kleomenes stared at his hands. The redirected grain shipments, the hidden accounts, the gold slowly being moved to Syracuse; any of it could surface if Theron looked closely enough.</p>
<p>"No concerns," he whispered.</p>
<p>"Excellent. Unity in leadership." Theron moved back to the railing. "The people need to see their council stands together. That we all agree: loyalty is not optional."</p>
<p>Below, the harbor master was led up the scaffold steps. He didn't struggle. Didn't plead. Just looked once toward the sea he'd tried to reach, then closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Polyidus's prayer beads clicked faster. "This is wrong."</p>
<p>"This is necessary," Theron said. "Watch carefully, gentlemen. This is the price of disloyalty."</p>
<p>The executioner raised his blade.</p>
<p>Polyidus turned away.</p>
<p>The blade fell.</p>
<p>Someone in the crowd shouted approval - one of Theron's men, planted there. Then another voice joined, and another. Not the whole crowd, but enough. The loyal, the frightened, the opportunistic - all cheering to be seen cheering.</p>
<p>The council members stood frozen. This was theater with a cultivated audience.</p>
<p>Polyidus recognized one of the voices. A temple guard. One of his own men, now cheering for Theron.</p>
<p>"Dismissed," Theron said. "And remember, I have men at every port."</p>
<p>As they filed toward the door, Asterion's hand went to his sword hilt - an old habit when calculating odds. His fingers touched bronze, then fell away. </p>
<p>Theron watched him, smile widening.</p>
<p>Asterion left without a word.</p>
<p>After they'd gone, Theron remained on the balcony, watching workers return to their tasks with new urgency. The message was clear: work hard, stay loyal, or join the harbor master.</p>
<p>Below in the darkness, something breathed in rhythm with his satisfaction. The King visited it, spoke to it, learned from it. Soon Theron would do the same. Because whatever lived beneath the palace, whatever required impossible prisons and foreign architects-</p>
<p>That was the real power in Crete now.</p>
<p>And he intended to understand it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Queen Pasiphaë received Theron in her formal chamber, dressed in full regalia. He bowed without looking at her, his eyes already cataloging details - the packed trunk behind the screen, correspondence with foreign kingdoms, the trade route map on her desk.</p>
<p>"Planning a journey, Majesty?"</p>
<p>"Sit, Lieutenant." She gestured to the chair across from her. "We need to speak plainly."</p>
<p>He sat, but his posture remained rigid. Watchful.</p>
<p>"What I'm about to tell you will sound like madness." she said, "But I need you to hear it. Not because I expect you to believe me. Not even because I think it will change anything." A pause. "Because someone should finally say it aloud."</p>
<p>"I'm listening."</p>
<p>She studied him for a long moment, this man who thought power meant control. Her fingers traced the armrest of her chair - the same motion she used when forcing herself still during court.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath. "Years ago, my husband offended Poseidon. The god's curse fell on me." She watched Theron's face carefully. "The bull from the sea. I tried to resist, but divine curses don't permit resistance. What I gave birth to should never have existed."</p>
<p>Her voice was steady. Calmer than she felt. The anger helped, she'd learned that years ago. Channel it into coldness, into precision. Let it sharpen her words instead of breaking them.</p>
<p>"Careful, Majesty." Theron's voice was soft. "Speaking ill of the King-"</p>
<p>"I'm not speaking ill. I'm stating fact." She leaned forward slightly. "Half bull, half man. Minos was horrified, but he was also fascinated. He couldn't kill it, whether from paternal feeling or divine prohibition, I've never been certain. So he commissioned the prison. Fed it. Raised it."</p>
<p>Theron's hand moved to his belt - not for a weapon, but for the small tablet he kept there. Taking notes. "These are serious accusations, Majesty."</p>
<p>She felt the familiar tightness in her chest. The same helpless rage that had defined her marriage, her motherhood, her entire cursed existence on this island. She'd tried so many times to stop this. To warn people. To find someone who would listen.</p>
<p>"They're not accusations. They're confession." She leaned forward. "The thing below is learning, growing stronger. The labyrinth won't hold it forever. When it breaks free-"</p>
<p>"You're suggesting the King knowingly harbors a monster?" Theron's stylus scratched against wax. "That he's built this entire project to contain his... what are you claiming, exactly?"</p>
<p>"I'm claiming he's corrupted something that was already an abomination. Made it worse. Fed it children to study how it learns." Her voice went quieter. "Whatever fathered it, he claimed it as his own. He sees it as his son."</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Then Theron set down his stylus with deliberate care. "Majesty, you're clearly under great strain. Perhaps-"</p>
<p>"Stop." She held up a hand. "We both know what you're doing. You're deciding how to use this. Whether to report me as mad, or treasonous, or simply inconvenient." Her smile was bitter. "So decide. But don't insult me by pretending concern."</p>
<p>"I'm trying to help-"</p>
<p>"You're trying to position yourself." She stood, moving to the window. The island stretched below; beautiful, cursed, inescapable. "You think if you can prove Minos is unfit, or I'm disloyal, you can seize control." She turned back to face him "You want power, but you can't see that the throne itself is poisoned" </p>
<p>"The King's authority is absolute. I merely ensure it remains so." A pause. "This conversation has been very illuminating, Majesty."</p>
<p>"Has it?" She moved closer, and for a moment her composure cracked. "I just told you the truth about divine punishment, monstrous offspring, and systematic murder. And all you heard was opportunity."</p>
<p>"Your honesty has been invaluable, Majesty."</p>
<p>After he left, she stood motionless. She'd tried to save him through truth, but instead he weaponized it.</p>
<p>The vibrations through the stone pulsed stronger. The Queen felt what Theron couldn't; the breathing rhythm she'd once carried inside her.</p>
<p>Theron would investigate. Dig deeper. Demand proof.</p>
<p>He'd get it.</p>
