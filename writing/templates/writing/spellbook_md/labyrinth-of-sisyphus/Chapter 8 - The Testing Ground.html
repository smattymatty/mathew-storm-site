<h1 id="chapter-8-the-testing-ground">Chapter 8 - The Testing Ground</h1>
<p>The cell was smaller than the boulder.</p>
<p>Sisyphus sat with his back against cold stone, hands resting on his knees.</p>
<p>Through the narrow window slit, he could hear the palace preparing for dawn. Footsteps in distant corridors. Voices giving orders. The scrape of benches being arranged in the courtyard; seating for the spectators. </p>
<p>Fair enough. Theater required an audience.</p>
<p>He examined the cell walls out of habit. Limestone blocks, decent craftsmanship, mortar joints showing minor settling cracks. The door was oak reinforced with iron bands. Standard construction. Nothing impossible about it.</p>
<p>Nothing like what waited below.</p>
<p>His hands moved without thinking, fingers tracing the wall beside him. Found a rough patch where the stone was softer. Started working at it with his thumbnail, carving shallow lines. Not words. Just marks.</p>
<p>Just keeping his hands busy.</p>
<p>And then-</p>
<p>Footsteps in the corridor. Closer than the others. Deliberate.</p>
<p>Sisyphus didn't move. Just waited.</p>
<p>The footsteps stopped outside his cell.</p>
<p>A key turned in the lock.</p>
<p>The door opened.</p>
<p>Queen PasiphaÃ« stood in the threshold, alone, holding a single oil lamp. No guards. No attendants. Just her, in the middle of the night, visiting a condemned man.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty," Sisyphus said, not standing. "Bit late for confessions."</p>
<p>She stepped inside. Closed the door behind her. Set the lamp on the floor between them and sat across from him with the practiced grace of someone used to maintaining composure.</p>
<p>"I'm not here to confess," she said. "I'm here to understand."</p>
<p>"Understand what?"</p>
<p>"Why." Her voice was controlled but her eyes were sharp, calculating. "You knew this would happen. You knew helping that boy would lead here. You chose it anyway."</p>
<p>"Theseus."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"His name was Theseus." Sisyphus met her gaze. "If we're discussing the dead, we should at least use their names."</p>
<p>The Queen's expression didn't change, but something flickered behind her eyes. Recognition, maybe. Of a pattern she knew too well.</p>
<p>"You gave him a path," she said. "Modified the passages. I worked it out after Theron found the evidence. The handholds, the reversed traps. All your work."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And he died anyway."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"So what did it accomplish?" Not accusatory. Genuinely asking. "You'll die tomorrow for giving him false hope. What was the point?"</p>
<p>Sisyphus was quiet for a moment, considering.</p>
<p>"He deserved a chance," he said finally.</p>
<p>"A chance to die slower?" The Queen leaned forward. "To suffer longer? To believe escape was possible right up until the moment it killed him?"</p>
<p>"A chance to try." Sisyphus's hands were still now. "The guard took his yarn. Casual cruelty. The boy came prepared and lost everything to someone who didn't even know what he'd done."</p>
<p>"So you gave him something else to lose."</p>
<p>"I gave him a choice. Push forward or give up. He chose to push." Sisyphus smiled slightly. "I respect that."</p>
<p>The Queen studied him. "You sound like you're talking about yourself."</p>
<p>"Maybe I am." he answered.</p>
<p>She stood abruptly, paced to the door, stopped. Her back to him. The golden bull brooch caught lamplight, shimmering its reflection onto the wall.</p>
<p>Her hand went to it, brief, unconscious. Then dropped.</p>
<p>Sisyphus looked at her. Really looked. The careful composure. The way she held herself like someone who'd learned to bear impossible weight.</p>
<p>She turned and came back. Sat down across from him again.</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a moment. The lamp flickered between them.</p>
<p>"I think," he said carefully, "that tomorrow will be instructive. For everyone watching."</p>
<p>"You're going to die." she replied.</p>
<p>"Probably."</p>
<p>"You sound almost pleased about it."</p>
<p>He didn't answer immediately. Just kept working the stone, thumbnail finding soft spots in the limestone. The scraping sound filled the cell.</p>
<p>The Queen moved closer, studying the marks he was making. "Those are handholds. Directions." She looked at him. "You're teaching the cell how to let people escape."</p>
<p>He said nothing.</p>
<p>"You really can't help yourself." She accused, "You see a cage, you have to hide a key. Even here. Even now. Knowing it's pointless."</p>
<p>"Especially when it's pointless." He laughed. "It's better than standing still."</p>
<p>"Is it?" Her voice rose. "Is it really? Theseus is dead. You'll be dead. Daedalus is locked in that tower drawing maps he can't deliver. All of us just-" </p>
<p>She stopped. Her hand went to the golden bull brooch, gripped it so hard her knuckles whitened.</p>
<p>"I tried to warn Theron," she said, voice controlled again but different now. Harder. "Told him the truth about what lives below. About Minos. About all of it. And he turned my confession into evidence. Used my honesty as a weapon."</p>
<p>She released the brooch. A red mark remained on her palm where the pin had pressed.</p>
<p>"Every truth I tell becomes a chain."</p>
<p>"I know," Sisyphus said.</p>
<p>"Then why do you keep trying?"</p>
<p>"Because otherwise we accept the cage."</p>
<p>Her hand moved to the brooch again. "And if the cage is all there is? If there's no outside to escape to?"</p>
<p>"Then we carve anyway," he said quietly. "Because the carving is the point."</p>
<p>She waited for more. He didn't give it.</p>
<p>"That's it?" she asked. "That's your reason?"</p>
<p>"What other reason do you need?"</p>
<p>"Something that actually makes sense. You're going to die tomorrow for-" She gestured at the wall scratches. "-for this. For helping a boy who died anyway. For carving handholds that lead nowhere."</p>
<p>His hands started moving again. Scrape, scrape, pause.</p>
<p>The Queen stood, collected her lamp. Moved to the door, then paused.</p>
<p>"They'll say you accomplished nothing." She whispered.</p>
<p>"We'll see."</p>
<p>"No." Her voice was firm. "We already saw. The question is whether you believe it mattered."</p>
<p>She left. The door closed. The key turned.</p>
<p>Sisyphus sat alone in the dark.</p>
<p>His hands found the wall again. Kept carving. The shallow grooves wouldn't help anyone escape - the cell door was oak and iron, the window too narrow. But his hands needed the work. Ten thousand years of touching stone, they didn't know how to stop.</p>
<p>Tomorrow he would be sent to death in front of the entire court.</p>
<p>He thought about Theseus climbing using modifications that shouldn't exist. About the Queen trying to save people with truth that became weapon.</p>
<p>He finished the pattern in the stone, and lay down on the cold floor. The stone was familiar. Comfortable, almost. He'd spent more time against stone than not.</p>
<p>He smiled in the darkness.</p>
<p>Not from joy, exactly, but from recognition. He knew this feeling. The night before the boulder. The morning it would roll down again. The certainty of what came next combined with the choice to face it anyway.</p>
<p>Tomorrow would be interesting.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>And slept.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dawn came grey and cold.</p>
<p>Sisyphus woke to the sound of keys turning. The door opened. Four guards stood in the corridor, fully armed despite knowing he wouldn't fight.</p>
<p>"Time," one of them said.</p>
<p>He stood, brushed stone dust from his clothes, and walked out.</p>
<p>They didn't bind his hands. Didn't need to. Where would he run? The palace was an island, and everyone on it was already trapped.</p>
<p>The courtyard was packed.</p>
<p>Every noble, every minister, every guard not on essential duty. Minos had made attendance mandatory. Wooden benches formed a semicircle around the labyrinth entrance - the one used for maintenance access, wide enough to accommodate an audience's view of the first passages below.</p>
<p>Minos sat on a portable throne at the center. The Queen stood beside him, face perfectly composed; a stark contrast from the night before. The council members arranged by rank: Polyidus clutching his prayer beads, lips moving in silent recitations that would save no one. Kleomenes with a ledger he wasn't reading, already calculating how to distance himself from this spectacle in his reports. </p>
<p>And Commander Asterion.</p>
<p>He stood apart from the others, not physically - protocol dictated his position - but in bearing. While the other council members found reasons to look away, to busy themselves with prayers or papers, Asterion watched the entrance with the steady gaze of someone who'd spent thirty years evaluating tactical situations. His weight was balanced, ready. A soldier's stance, not a courtier's.</p>
<p>When Sisyphus emerged into the courtyard, Asterion's eyes tracked him with professional assessment. Not the morbid curiosity of the nobles. Not the fearful avoidance of his fellow councilors. Just the calculating attention of someone measuring another man's capabilities, his chances. His worth.</p>
<p>Their eyes met for half a second across the courtyard.</p>
<p>Asterion gave the smallest nod. So brief that anyone watching would miss it. A warrior's acknowledgment of another man walking into battle.</p>
<p>Then he resumed his position, hands clasped behind his back, face carefully neutral. But unlike Polyidus with his useless prayers, unlike Kleomenes with his coward's ledger, Asterion didn't look away.</p>
<p>Sisyphus continued walking, then looked up at the tower.</p>
<p>In the highest window, a figure stood watching. Daedalus. Hands pressed against the glass. Confined to quarters by Minos's order - not arrested, not punished, but isolated. Made to watch what happened to architects who defied the King.</p>
<p>Their eyes met across the distance.</p>
<p>Sisyphus nodded once.</p>
<p>Then the guards positioned him at the entrance. The crowd pressed closer, craning for better views.</p>
<p>"Sisyphus of Corinth." Minos's voice carried across the courtyard. "You stand convicted of sabotage, insubordination, and unauthorized modification of royal construction. The sentence is death by testing. You will descend into the sections you modified and prove whether your mercy makes survival possible."</p>
<p>The king paused for effect. The crowd murmured.</p>
<p>"If you emerge alive," Minos continued, "your sentence will be reconsidered. If you do not..." He gestured to the darkness below. "Then we will know your compassion was simply elaborate cruelty."</p>
<p>Sisyphus said nothing. Just looked at the entrance - stone stairs descending into blackness that seemed to have weight.</p>
<p>"Any final words?" Minos asked.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then descend."</p>
<p>Sisyphus took the first step down. Behind him, guards moved to seal the entrance once he was deep enough. He could hear the crowd shuffling, positioning themselves for the best view of his descent.</p>
<p>He took another step. Then another. The darkness swallowed him.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the tower workshop, Daedalus stood at the window watching the courtyard empty. Guards returning to posts. Nobles dispersing to discuss what they'd witnessed. The Queen ascending palace steps with Lysippe close behind.</p>
<p>The entrance to the labyrinth sat sealed.</p>
<p>Sisyphus was down there. Alone. Facing traps Daedalus had designed to be lethal.</p>
<p>His hands reached for papyrus without thinking. He began sketching passage configurations, trap timings, the routes that offered the least resistance. Escape paths he couldn't deliver.</p>
<p>The stylus moved faster. Frantic calculations. If Sisyphus survived the first corridor, he'd face the collapsing walls. If he survived those, the blade passages. If he survived those-</p>
<p>Daedalus stopped.</p>
<p>He was drawing solutions for a dead man.</p>
<p>His hand trembled. The stylus clattered to the workbench.</p>
<p>Through the window, he could see Nikias and Alexios standing near the sealed entrance. Both guards staring at the stone as if they could see through it. Both knowing they'd watched a man descend to his death because they'd stayed silent.</p>
<hr />
<p>The labyrinth swallowed sound.</p>
<p>Sisyphus counted steps - twenty-three down before the entrance disappeared above. The darkness was absolute for three breaths. Then torches ignited along the walls with sharp hisses, revealing the passage ahead.</p>
<p>Daedalus's design. Automatic lighting triggered by weight on specific stairs. </p>
<p>The passage split into three corridors. Sisyphus chose left, following the airflow. Ten paces in, the floor dropped away beneath a trigger stone. He stopped three steps before it, watching the shadows.</p>
<p>Picked up a loose rock. Tossed it onto the trap.</p>
<p>The floor tilted immediately. Three seconds of movement, then pause. Reset in ten seconds.</p>
<p>A rhythm. Like the boulder. Everything had a rhythm.</p>
<p>He crossed during the reset. Continued deeper.</p>
<p>The second corridor brought walls that closed on pressure plates. He triggered one deliberately, counted the timing. Two seconds to close. Five seconds to retract.</p>
<p>The third corridor had sweeping blades. Seven seconds. Three seconds. That was the pattern he had helped Daedalus design.</p>
<p>He walked through the gaps, patient, unhurried.</p>
<p>Somewhere deeper, that familiar breathing. Slower, heavier. The Minotaur was tracking him.</p>
<p>Sisyphus descended further. Each trap teaching him the labyrinth's logic. Each pattern revealing the language beneath the horror.</p>
<p>He'd pushed a boulder for ten thousand years. He knew patience. He knew rhythm.</p>
<p>The labyrinth spoke that same language.</p>
<p>Then he heard a scream.</p>
<p>Distant. A woman's voice. Cut short by exhaustion.</p>
<p>Sisyphus stopped, the smoothness of his flow had been disrupted.</p>
<p>The scream came again. Weaker. From somewhere ahead and to the right.</p>
<p>The passage forward was clear. Dark stone descending deeper into sections he knew how to navigate. Patterns he'd learned. Rhythm he understood.</p>
<p>Another scream. Barely a sound. Someone was dying slowly in the dark.</p>
<p>Survival lay straight ahead.</p>
<p>He turned toward the sound.</p>
