<h1 id="chapter-12-the-escape">Chapter 12 - The Escape</h1>
<p>Sisyphus had been carving the same spot for six hours when the blueprint appeared.</p>
<p>The cell was small, stone on all sides, single torch that guttered every few minutes. Three days since the courtyard erupted into civil war. Three days since Theron's guards had dragged him here and sealed the door.</p>
<p>He'd started carving the second morning. Not because he thought it would work - the walls were thick, the stone solid - but because sitting still felt wrong.</p>
<p>He'd chosen a spot near the floor where the wall met the corner. Seemed reasonable. The metal cup they'd given him for water had a rim that could scrape stone if you hit it right. Each strike removed a tiny amount of material. Probably needed ten thousand strikes to make any real progress.</p>
<p>He was on maybe the two thousandth when something slid under the door.</p>
<p>Paper. Rolled tight to fit the gap.</p>
<p>Sisyphus set down the cup, picked up the paper, unrolled it.</p>
<p>A blueprint. The cell. His cell. Drawn with perfect precision. Measurements, angles, stone composition marked in Daedalus's cramped handwriting.</p>
<p>And there, marked with a circle and the number "347," a point on the wall three feet from where Sisyphus had been working.</p>
<p>He stared at it.</p>
<p>Then at the spot he'd been carving for six hours.</p>
<p>Then back at the blueprint.</p>
<p>The marked point was a stress junction where three different stone layers met at slightly offset angles. The blueprint showed the internal structure, the way the weight distributed, the exact angle where patient force would propagate a crack through all three layers at once.</p>
<p>Where Sisyphus had been working was... nowhere special. Just stone. Solid, thick, completely wrong.</p>
<p>He could have carved for six hundred hours and accomplished nothing.</p>
<p>He set the blueprint down carefully, looked at the marked point, then picked up his cup.</p>
<p>Moved to the spot Daedalus had indicated.</p>
<p>Began striking. Same rhythm, same patience, but now directed with precision.</p>
<p>Patience needs genius.</p>
<p>The thought made him smile slightly.</p>
<p>And genius needs patience.</p>
<p>Each strike landed exactly where the blueprint showed. The stone didn't give immediately, that wasn't how this worked, but he could feel the difference. The cup's rim bit deeper here. The sound was subtly wrong, like the stone was less certain of itself.</p>
<p>After the three hundred and forty-seventh strike, a hairline crack appeared.</p>
<p>Sisyphus paused, ran his finger along it. Barely visible, but there. Following the grain of the stone exactly as Daedalus had predicted.</p>
<p>He looked at the blueprint again. The next page showed the progression, how the crack would spread, where to strike next, how many more hits before the gap was large enough.</p>
<p>He picked up the cup and continued working.</p>
<p>Strike. Rest. Strike. Rest.</p>
<p>Around strike five hundred, he heard sounds from outside. Distant shouts. Steel on steel. The civil war's background noise, constant now. Asterion's forces testing Theron's perimeter, or vice versa. </p>
<p>The palace tearing itself apart while he carved an exit.</p>
<p>Strike seven hundred and twelve: the crack reached the junction point Daedalus had marked.</p>
<p>Strike eight hundred and three: a second crack appeared, perpendicular to the first. The two met at the marked junction, forming a weak point.</p>
<p>Strike nine hundred and forty-seven: a piece of stone the size of his fist came loose.</p>
<p>Sisyphus set it aside carefully. Began working the gap, widening it with methodical strikes. Not rushing,rushing would trigger the wrong stress patterns, seal the crack back up.</p>
<p>Two more hours of patient work and the gap was large enough.</p>
<p>He looked at the next page of the blueprint. A map. Not of the cell, but of the palace. Maintenance passages marked in red, servants' routes, the paths that ran behind walls, the ones guards never watched because they'd been there so long everyone forgot they existed.</p>
<p>A path from here to the tower.</p>
<p>Daedalus had mapped his escape from the inside out.</p>
<p>Sisyphus rolled up the blueprint, tucked it into his tunic, and began squeezing through the gap. Stone scraped his shoulders, his ribs. He exhaled completely, made himself thin, worked through inch by inch.</p>
<p>On the other side: darkness. A maintenance corridor, narrow, unused. Dust thick on the floor—no footprints.</p>
<p>He pulled himself through, stood up, brushed stone dust from his clothes.</p>
<p>The blueprint showed twelve turns between here and the tower. Each one marked with timing, guard patrols, shift changes, windows of opportunity.</p>
<p>Behind him, in the cell, the gap in the wall was barely visible if you weren't looking for it. The guards outside wouldn't notice until the next meal delivery.</p>
<p>By then he'd be back at work.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thalia had been walking for an hour when her leg finally gave out.</p>
<p>Not broke again, it was already broken, just refusing to hold her anymore. Three days since crawling out of the labyrinth during the chaos. Three days of hiding in storage rooms, sleeping in alcoves, stealing bread from abandoned kitchens. The splint Sisyphus had made was still holding, barely. The fever was worse.</p>
<p>The palace grounds looked like a war zone. Bodies cleared but bloodstains remaining. Guards in different colors clustered at chokepoints: Theron's blue facing Asterion's bronze across courtyards neither controlled. Skirmishes had carved the palace into territories.</p>
<p>She'd aimed for the Queen's wing. Royal guard territory: purple and gold. If she could just reach-</p>
<p>A patrol spotted her. Three guards, hands on spears.</p>
<p>"Stop! Identify yourself!"</p>
<p>She tried to stand straighter, failed. Her leg buckled.</p>
<p>"Please... I need to see the Queen."</p>
<p>They came closer, saw her properly. Clothes torn and filthy. Labyrinth dust, caked into her skin. The crude splint. Days of dirt and fever.</p>
<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>
<p>"Below. I was-" The words tangled. Too many. "I need to see the Queen. I have information about-"</p>
<p>The world tilted sideways.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Queen's private chambers had become a war room by necessity.</p>
<p>Maps spread across tables. Messages from various noble factions stacked in careful piles, sorted by threat level, Lysippe's system. The golden bull brooch caught lamplight as Pasiphaë leaned over a report from the eastern wing where Kleomenes was fortifying his position, hedging his bets between both sides.</p>
<p>"He'll wait until one faction clearly wins," Lysippe said, reading over her shoulder. "Then claim he supported them all along."</p>
<p>"Smart. Cowardly, but smart." The Queen set the report aside, moved to the next. "What about the grain stores?"</p>
<p>"Split. Theron controls the main warehouse. Asterion controls the docks."</p>
<p>"So both sides can starve each other slowly. Excellent." She rubbed her temples. Three days of this. Three days of managing a palace that was tearing itself apart while Minos remained locked in his chambers, finger-drumming his way through whatever remained of his sanity.</p>
<p>A knock. Urgent.</p>
<p>"Enter."</p>
<p>Two royal guards, purple and gold, carrying a woman between them. Young, filthy, feverish. One leg splinted with what looked like torn cloth and a piece of wood.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, this woman came from the labyrinth. She collapsed asking for you."</p>
<p>The Queen crossed the room in three steps.</p>
<p>Saw the face beneath the dirt and fever. Recognition immediate.</p>
<p>"Thalia."</p>
<p>Lysippe moved closer, eyes widening. "The maid who asked questions."</p>
<p>"The one Theron disappeared." The Queen knelt, ignoring the dirt that would stain her dress. Placed a hand on Thalia's forehead - burning. "How long has she been like this?"</p>
<p>"Unknown, Your Majesty. We found her on the grounds. She made it to our territory before collapsing."</p>
<p>Thalia's eyes flickered open. Unfocused, but seeing. Her lips moved.</p>
<p>The Queen leaned closer.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty..." Barely a whisper. "He saved me... the architect..."</p>
<p>The Queen and Lysippe exchanged a glance.</p>
<p>Sisyphus.</p>
<p>"Fetch the physician. Now." The Queen's voice cut through any hesitation. "And bring water, clean cloth, blankets. Move."</p>
<p>The guards scattered.</p>
<p>Lysippe helped ease Thalia onto the couch, careful of the broken leg. "She shouldn't be alive. Nothing survives down there for days."</p>
<p>"He died... so I could..."</p>
<p>Then unconsciousness took her completely.</p>
<p>The Queen held her hand for a moment longer, then stood.</p>
<p>"Keep her alive," she told the physician. "I need to hear what she knows."</p>
<p>"Yes, Your Majesty."</p>
<p>To Lysippe, quietly: "Find out how she made it to our territory. And make sure no one else knows she's here."</p>
<p>Lysippe moved to execute the orders, then paused. "What if she knows something about... it?"</p>
<p>The Queen didn't need to ask what "it" meant.</p>
<p>"Then we'll finally have testimony from someone who survived." She looked at Thalia, breathing more steadily now under the physician's care. "Someone who can tell us what the Minotaur actually is."</p>
<p>"We already know what it is."</p>
<p>"No." The Queen's voice was soft. "We know what Minos made it. We don't know what it's becoming."</p>
<hr />
<p>The maintenance passages were exactly as the blueprint showed.</p>
<p>At the seventh turn, he heard voices. Distant. Two men arguing about grain rations and whose responsibility it was to count the stores. The argument faded as he moved past, separated by stone walls that muffled everything to background noise.</p>
<p>The blueprint had been right about the timing too. Each patrol window exactly as Daedalus predicted. The palace was at war with itself, but the guards still kept their schedules.</p>
<p>The twelfth turn opened onto a narrow staircase. Sisyphus climbed, emerged into a corridor he recognized. The tower was close now. Just around-</p>
<p>He stopped.</p>
<p>Two guards at the tower entrance. Sitting against the wall, spears leaning beside them.</p>
<p>Nikias and Alexios.</p>
<p>Both looked exhausted. Three days of civil war would do that. Alexios's head was tilted back against stone, eyes closed. Nikias sat with his chin on his chest, breathing the slow rhythm of someone barely awake.</p>
<p>Sisyphus studied the corridor. No other route. The blueprint had only shown one entrance to the tower, this one.</p>
<p>He stepped forward carefully.</p>
<p>His foot found a loose stone.</p>
<p>Alexios's eyes snapped open.</p>
<p>His hand went to the spear beside him, he grabbed it, then froze.</p>
<p>He stared at Sisyphus standing in the corridor shadows.</p>
<p>Long moment. Neither moving.</p>
<p>Alexios's grip on the spear tightened. Then loosened. His eyes were wide but not with fear. Something else. Recognition. Understanding. Maybe relief.</p>
<p>Sisyphus spoke quietly. "If anyone asks, I snuck past you."</p>
<p>Alexios glanced at Nikias—still sleeping somehow, or pretending to be.</p>
<p>Looked back at Sisyphus.</p>
<p>Then slowly, deliberately, closed his eyes again. Leaned his head back against the wall. Set the spear down beside him with a soft <em>click</em> against stone.</p>
<p>Silent permission.</p>
<p>Sisyphus walked past them. Neither guard moved. Neither spoke.</p>
<p>At the tower door, he looked back once. Alexios's eyes were still closed. Nikias hadn't stirred.</p>
<p>Two men choosing not to see.</p>
<p>Their own quiet rebellion.</p>
<p>He pushed open the door.</p>
<hr />
<p>The workshop was lit by a single lamp, oil burning low.</p>
<p>Daedalus sat hunched over the worktable, surrounded by blueprints. Not labyrinth plans—something else. Drawings of the same cell from different angles. Calculations in the margins. Stress points marked and remarked.</p>
<p>He was so focused he didn't hear the door.</p>
<p>Sisyphus cleared his throat softly.</p>
<p>Daedalus spun, knocking a stylus to the floor. His face cycled through terror, recognition, disbelief, relie - all in the space of a breath.</p>
<p>"You got my plans."</p>
<p>"They worked."</p>
<p>Daedalus stood, hands shaking. Not from fear. From something else.</p>
<p>"I thought-" His voice cracked. "Three days. I thought you were-"</p>
<p>"I was." Sisyphus moved to the table. "Death rejected me. Too much paperwork."</p>
<p>Daedalus made a sound between laugh and sob. "Of course it did. You're too annoying even for death!"</p>
<p>"Exactly." Sisyphus joined in his friends' laughter as he spoke.</p>
<p>Daedalus's eyes were wet but he didn't wipe them. Just stood there, architect and assistant, separated by ten feet of workshop floor.</p>
<p>Then Sisyphus moved to the table. Looked at the blueprints spread there.</p>
<p>"What are you working on?"</p>
<p>"The-" Daedalus's voice caught. He cleared it. "The northwestern passage. It's collapsing again."</p>
<p>"Show me."</p>
<p>Daedalus pulled over the relevant blueprint. They leaned over it together, shoulders nearly touching. Falling into the old rhythm like the three days apart had been three minutes.</p>
<p>"Here." Daedalus pointed. "Same stress point as last time. The foundation is settling unevenly."</p>
<p>"Because the Minotaur's passages underneath are redistributing the weight."</p>
<p>"Exactly. If we reinforce here—" His stylus traced a line. "—we might buy another week."</p>
<p>"Only a week?"</p>
<p>Sisyphus picked up the stylus, made a small mark on the blueprint. "Here. Add a support column. Disguise it as decorative. It'll hold longer."</p>
<p>"That's clever."</p>
<p>"I learned it from someone."</p>
<p>They worked in silence for a while. Marking reinforcements. Calculating stress loads. The partnership reforming not through words but through shared purpose.</p>
<p>Finally Daedalus spoke, not looking up from the blueprint. "I thought you'd leave."</p>
<p>"Where would I go?"</p>
<p>"Anywhere. You escaped. You could have joined Asterion, fled Crete, just... vanished."</p>
<p>"And leave the northwestern passage to collapse?" Sisyphus added another mark. "That's sloppy craftsmanship."</p>
<p>Daedalus did look up then. Studied his partner's face.</p>
<p>"You came back to work."</p>
<p>"I came back to work."</p>
<p>"They'll imprison you again."</p>
<p>"Probably."</p>
<p>"And you'll escape again."</p>
<p>"If I need to."</p>
<p>"And come back here."</p>
<p>"Yes." Sisyphus met his eyes. "Because the work matters. Because someone has to maintain what we built. Because-" He paused. "Because I chose this boulder. And I'm going to keep pushing it."</p>
<p>Daedalus wiped his eyes finally. Tried to make it look like he was just tired.</p>
<p>"The northwestern passage," he said, voice rough. "If we don't reinforce it soon-"</p>
<p>"Then we reinforce it soon." Sisyphus rolled up the blueprint. "Tomorrow. Tonight we plan."</p>
<p>Daedalus looked at the workshop around them. The tools in their places. The blueprints organized by section. The wine cups, two of them, waiting on the shelf.</p>
<p>Outside, in the corridor, Nikias and Alexios remained at their posts. Eyes closed. Seeing nothing.</p>
<p>Inside the tower, two architects returned to their work.</p>
<p>The northwestern passage wouldn't collapse tonight. Or tomorrow. Or the day after.</p>
<p>Not while they had something to say about it.</p>
