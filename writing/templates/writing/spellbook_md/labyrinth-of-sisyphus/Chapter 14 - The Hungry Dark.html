<h1 id="chapter-14-the-hungry-dark">Chapter 14 - The Hungry Dark</h1>
<p>The week passed slowly.</p>
<p>Stalemate held. Theron's blue guards controlled the palace interior—corridors, armories, the tower. Asterion's bronze military held the grounds—gates, docks, outer walls. The royal guard in purple maintained their thin corridor between King's chambers and Queen's wing, a neutral buffer neither side could breach without triggering full war.</p>
<p>So they bled each other in small skirmishes instead. Daily clashes at boundary points. Probing attacks. Testing. Three dead here, five wounded there. The palace fracturing stone by stone while everyone waited for someone else to break first.</p>
<p>The labyrinth went unattended. Reports came to both Theron and Asterion—drainage backing up, passages shifting, tools moving overnight, but neither could spare the resources to investigate. The civil war consumed everything.</p>
<p>In the Queen's chambers, Thalia healed.</p>
<p>The physician came twice daily. Changed bandages, checked the leg, monitored the fever. By the third day, the fever broke. By the fifth, she could sit up without help. By the seventh, she could walk with assistance, limping badly but functional.</p>
<p>The Queen visited every day. Sometimes just sitting quietly while Thalia slept. Sometimes bringing food, wine, clean clothes. Building trust through presence, not words.</p>
<p>They didn't speak much at first. Thalia was too exhausted, too traumatized. The Queen too careful, knowing one wrong question could shatter whatever fragile recovery had begun.</p>
<p>But on the eighth day, the Queen brought something different.</p>
<p>She entered the chambers carrying a small wooden box. Lysippe followed with wine and cups, set them on the low table, withdrew to give them privacy.</p>
<p>Thalia was sitting on the couch, leg propped on cushions. Stronger now. Color returned to her face. The haunted look fading, replaced by something harder. Survival.</p>
<p>The Queen sat across from her. Set the box on the table between them.</p>
<p>"Can you walk today?" she asked.</p>
<p>"A little. With help." Thalia's voice was steadier than a week ago. "The physician says the bone is setting properly."</p>
<p>"Good." The Queen poured wine into two cups. Handed one to Thalia. "You'll need to walk soon. When things get worse."</p>
<p>They drank in silence. Through the window, distant sounds of another skirmish. Steel on steel. Shouting. Then silence again.</p>
<p>"I wanted to thank you," the Queen said finally. "For coming here. For trusting me with what you knew."</p>
<p>Thalia looked at her cup. "I didn't know where else to go."</p>
<p>"You could have fled. Joined the escaping tributes. Left Crete entirely."</p>
<p>"I thought about it." Thalia's fingers traced the cup's rim. "But... he died for me. The architect. And I couldn't just run. Not without someone knowing what he did."</p>
<p>"He showed you mercy."</p>
<p>"More than that." Thalia looked up. "He showed me that someone still cared. In a place designed to strip that away."</p>
<p>The Queen set down her cup. Opened the wooden box.</p>
<p>Inside, resting on black cloth: the golden bull brooch.</p>
<p>Thalia recognized it immediately. Every servant in the palace knew that brooch. The Queen wore it constantly, a symbol of her position, her power, her-</p>
<p>"Do you know what this means?" the Queen asked quietly.</p>
<p>"It's... your brooch. The bull. Everyone knows it."</p>
<p>"But do you know why I wear it?"</p>
<p>Hesitation. "No, Your Majesty."</p>
<p>The Queen lifted the brooch from the box. Held it in her palm, studying it like she'd studied it ten thousand times before.</p>
<p>"I'm going to tell you a story," she said. "And when I'm finished, you'll understand."</p>
<p>Thalia waited.</p>
<p>The Queen's hand closed around the brooch.</p>
<p>"Poseidon sent a sacred bull to my husband," she began. "A perfect creature. White as marble, strong as the sea. Meant to be sacrificed in the god's honor."</p>
<p>She paused. Outside, another skirmish erupted and died.</p>
<p>"Minos kept it instead."</p>
<hr />
<p>"You're not sleeping either," Nikias asked his young colleague.</p>
<p>Alexios sat against the tower wall, staring at nothing. "Can't. Every time I close my eyes, I hear it."</p>
<p>"Hear what?"</p>
<p>"The silence. The breathing stopped yesterday. You must have noticed."</p>
<p>Nikias had noticed. That constant rhythm from below, present for years, had gone quiet sometime around midday. Like a heartbeat stopping.</p>
<p>"Maybe it died," Alexios offered. No hope in his voice. Just words to fill the silence.</p>
<p>"Things like that don't die." Nikias checked his spear, old habit. "They change. Evolve. Become something else."</p>
<p>They sat in silence. Around them, the palace slept uneasily. Patrols passed. Somewhere distant, a brief clash of steel. The civil war's background noise.</p>
<p>"I keep thinking about the architect," Alexios said finally. "The way he just... came back. Fell from the sky and stood up like dying was inconvenient."</p>
<p>"What about it?"</p>
<p>"The Minotaur killed him. Crushed him. And he came back anyway." Alexios looked at Nikias. "What if it learned from that? What if it learned you can't keep something caged if it's willing to die to get out?"</p>
<p>Nikias was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Get some rest. I'll take the watch."</p>
<p>"I told you, I can't sleep-"</p>
<p>"Then pretend. Because tomorrow..." Nikias gripped his spear tighter. "Tomorrow I think we're all going to need our strength."</p>
<hr />
<p>Thalia's face had gone pale. Horror and pity warring in her expression as understanding dawned.</p>
<p>The Queen's hand moved to her own stomach. An unconscious gesture, protective even now years later.</p>
<p>"The pregnancy was..." She stopped. Started again. "Poseidon's curse doesn't care about the body it destroys. Nine months of knowing what grew inside me. What I'd been forced to create."</p>
<p>"Your Majesty-"</p>
<p>"The birth nearly killed me." The Queen's voice was steady but her knuckles were white around the brooch. "The midwives fled. Screamed about demons, about abominations. Only Lysippe stayed."</p>
<p>Thalia glanced toward the door where Lysippe had withdrawn. Understanding why the handmaid's loyalty ran so deep.</p>
<p>"But after..." The Queen's expression softened slightly. "After, when they brought him to me, I tried. I raised him for a year. Held him. Fed him. Sang to him."</p>
<p>"Sang to him," Thalia repeated softly. Recognition in her voice. "The lullaby. When the Minotaur..." Thalia stopped. "When it calmed. There was a sound. Like humming. I thought I imagined it."</p>
<p>"You didn't." The Queen set the brooch down carefully. "He remembered. After all these years in the dark, he remembered his mother's song."</p>
<p>Silence. Just the distant sounds of the palace at war with itself.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Thalia asked quietly. "Why the labyrinth?"</p>
<p>"Minos." The word came out bitter. "He saw what I'd borne. Saw his punishment made flesh. And he was ashamed." She picked up her wine, drank. "Not of what he'd done. Of what people would say. That the great King Minos had a monster for a son."</p>
<p>"So he built a prison."</p>
<p>"He built a tomb. Daedalus designed it, and Minos took my child - one year old, barely able to walk - and locked him in the dark." Her voice cracked slightly. "Said it was mercy. Said it was for safety. For Crete."</p>
<p>"But it was to hide his shame."</p>
<p>"It was pride." The Queen's hand closed into a fist. "His pride destroyed our son. Turned him into exactly what Minos feared he'd become."</p>
<p>Thalia was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Sisyphus knew, didn't he?"</p>
<p>The Queen looked up. "Knew what?"</p>
<p>"That it wasn't just a monster. That it was someone." Thalia's voice grew more certain. "He talked to it. Before he died. Told it mercy mattered. Like he was trying to teach it something. Trying to reach whatever was still..." She gestured helplessly. "...still human inside."</p>
<p>"And it killed him anyway."</p>
<p>"Yes." Thalia met her eyes. "But it let me go. It could have killed us both. I was right there. It chose to focus on him instead. To study him. That's not just hunger, is it? That's..."</p>
<p>"Choice," the Queen finished. "Agency."</p>
<p>"Is that possible? After years of being caged, being fed people, being treated like an animal, can something like that still choose?"</p>
<p>The Queen was silent for a long time. Outside, the palace bled and no one came to help. Inside, two women sat with the weight of impossible questions.</p>
<p>She finally answered: "I don't know. But the fact that you're alive suggests it might be."</p>
<hr />
<p>Commander Asterion stood over the body.</p>
<p>Bronze armor. Asterion's colors. One of his own soldiers, killed in a skirmish over a warehouse.</p>
<p>"Sir." Captain Hemon approached, careful not to step in the blood. "Theron's forces have withdrawn. The position is ours."</p>
<p>Asterion looked at the dead boy. At the warehouse. At the six other bodies - four of theirs, two of Theron's - scattered across stone that had been scrubbed clean just yesterday.</p>
<p>"Congratulations," he said flatly.</p>
<p>Hemon shifted. "Sir, the men are asking-"</p>
<p>"I never wanted this." The words came out before he could stop them. "I called them mad. Both of them. The King and his lieutenant. And now I'm leading men to die for corridors and courtyards because the alternative is..." He gestured at the palace. "Is letting them finish destroying everything."</p>
<p>"The men believe in you."</p>
<p>"The men are exhausted." Asterion looked at Hemon. "How many deserted last night?"</p>
<p>Hemon's silence was answer enough.</p>
<p>"We're not fighting for Crete anymore," Asterion said quietly. "We're fighting because stopping means admitting none of this mattered. That good men died for nothing."</p>
<p>"Then what do we do?"</p>
<p>Asterion looked at the dead boy again. Tried to remember his name. Couldn't.</p>
<p>"We keep fighting," he said. "Because the alternative is worse."</p>
<p>He walked away, leaving Hemon to organize the body detail.</p>
<p>Behind him, soldiers gathered around the warehouse they'd just won. Three sacks of grain. A broken cart wheel.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thalia had fallen asleep on the couch, exhausted from the conversation. The Queen had covered her with a blanket, adjusted the pillows supporting her leg, then moved to the window.</p>
<p>The sun was setting. The palace cast long shadows across courtyards that had become battlegrounds. From this height, she could see the territorial divisions clearly: blue guards at the inner gates, bronze soldiers at the outer walls, her own purple corridor between them like a vein trying to hold a dying body together.</p>
<p>Lysippe entered quietly, carrying a fresh lamp. Set it on the table without disturbing Thalia, then joined the Queen at the window.</p>
<p>They stood in silence, watching another small skirmish erupt near the eastern warehouse. A few minutes of shouting and steel, then both sides withdrew. Testing. Always testing.</p>
<p>"She's strong," Lysippe said finally.</p>
<p>"She survived the labyrinth. She'd have to be."</p>
<p>"I meant emotionally. Hearing what you told her. Understanding what it means."</p>
<p>The Queen's hand moved to the bull brooch at her throat. She'd put it back on after showing Thalia. Felt wrong not to wear it, like denying what she was.</p>
<p>"She needed to know," the Queen said. "Before..."</p>
<p>"Before it breaks out."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>More silence. Below, servants scurried between buildings, trying to avoid both factions. Fewer each day. Most had fled by now.</p>
<p>"You can't stop a civil war and save the Minotaur," Lysippe said quietly.</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"You'll have to choose. The palace or your son. Order or mercy."</p>
<p>"I know that too."</p>
<p>Lysippe was quiet for a moment. Then: "Which will you choose?"</p>
<p>The Queen didn't answer immediately. Watched another skirmish begin and end. More blood on stone. The palace eating itself while something built in the darkness below.</p>
<p>"I spent fifteen years choosing the palace," she said finally. "Choosing Minos's shame over my son's life. Choosing order over mercy."</p>
<p>"And now?"</p>
<p>"Now I understand what the architect was trying to teach me." She touched the brooch. "That being trapped by a curse doesn't make you a monster. But letting others suffer for it does."</p>
<p>"So you'll stand with him. When he breaks free."</p>
<p>"I'll stand between him and the people trying to kill him. Yes."</p>
<p>"Even if it means-"</p>
<p>"Even if it means everything." The Queen's voice was firm. "I've already lost him once. I won't watch him die for my husband's pride."</p>
<p>Below, the palace fractured further. Cracks spreading through stone, through alliances, through whatever had held this place together.</p>
<p>The Queen's hand closed around the brooch. Felt the sharp edges pressing into her palm.</p>
<p>"Get some rest," she told Lysippe. "Tomorrow will be long."</p>
<p>"And you?"</p>
<p>"I'll watch a while longer."</p>
<p>Lysippe withdrew. The Queen remained at the window, one hand on the brooch, watching her kingdom destroy itself.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the darkness below, her son waited.</p>
<p>Patient. Methodical. Building his escape stone by stone.</p>
<p>Just like the architects had taught him.</p>
<p>She wondered if he remembered her voice. If years of darkness had erased the lullabies she'd sung, or if some part of him still knew.</p>
<p>Soon, she'd find out.</p>
<p>The sun set completely. The palace disappeared into shadow.</p>
<p>But the skirmishes continued.</p>
<p>And beneath it all, patient silence in the dark</p>
<p>Waiting.</p>
