<p>Exploring the intersection of technology and philosophy.</p>
<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
<p>Digital sovereignty, the federated web, and what it means to build human-centered infrastructure.</p>
<p>Recursive absurdism, techno-absurdism - how we create technology that respects human agency rather than extracting from it.</p>
<h2 id="recent-thinking">Recent Thinking</h2>
<p>The federated social web isn't just a technical architecture - it's a political statement about who controls our digital infrastructure.</p>
<p>Self-hosted systems aren't for hobbyists. They're how organizations maintain sovereignty and transparency.</p>
<p>Technology and philosophy are inseparable. The tools we build encode values.</p>
