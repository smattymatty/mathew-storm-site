            <p>Camus defined the absurd as the confrontation between our human need for meaning and the universe's unreasonable silence. We cry out "Why?" and the cosmos doesn't answer.</p>
<p>The traditional absurd: "Life has no inherent meaning."</p>
<p>The recursive absurd: "Life has no inherent meaning, so we built an app for that. The app needs constant updates, and updating the app has become our meaning, except we've forgotten why we built it."</p>

<h2 id="i-the-boulder-that-learns">I. The Boulder That Learns</h2>
<p>Camus asked us to imagine Sisyphus happy. He never imagined that the boulder would eventually develop machine learning capabilities.</p>
<p>The original absurd was discovered; ours is engineered and capitalized upon. Camus faced a cosmic indifference. We face a calculated indifference, hard-coded into systems whose primary function is the extraction of value from our behavior. </p>
<p>This is the <strong>recursive absurd</strong>: a condition where our own alienated labor is captured as data to train the very boulder we are forced to push. The boulder's "learning" is not a neutral, emergent property; it is the logic of surveillance capitalism, running on a physical stack of servers that consume power from a grid built on premises of endless growth. Through centuries of endless loops and cycles that nobody understands anymore, we've manufactured our own absurdity.</p>

            <p>In The Burnout Society, Byung-Chul Han argues that contemporary exhaustion stems not from external oppression but from self-exploitation. We've internalized the demand for productivity so completely that we become our own harshest taskmasters. Han describes the "achievement subject" who "exploits itself voluntarily without external constraints."</p>

<p>Meaningless labor wasn't enough, we had to optimize it. Not satisfied with futile tasks, we gamify them. The modern condition isn't just that life lacks inherent meaning; it's that we've built systems to manufacture false meaning at scale, then lost the ability to distinguish the manufactured from the real.</p>
<p>Where Camus's rebel could at least shake his fist at the heavens, we train the machines that train us. We cannot properly rebel against our condition because we are simultaneously its victim, its author, and increasingly, its substance.</p>

            <p>Bernard Stiegler called this "grammatization" - the breaking down of continuous experience into discrete, calculable units. Writing turned flowing speech into letters.

<p>The algorithm doesn't hate us; that would require caring. It optimizes us with the same indifference the universe showed Camus, but this time we helped build the universe ourselves. Through recursive loops we no longer comprehend, we have become the boulder itself.</p>
<p>An algorithm is indifferent to you the way a factory is indifferent to the pig on the assembly line: its internal logic is ruthlessly optimized toward a predetermined, non-negotiable goal. That goal (engagement, monetization, control) was not written by "us" in some collective act of creation. It was funded by venture capital and designed to serve a market. </p>
<p>The incomprehensibility of these recursive loops is a feature, not a bug; it is an obfuscation that protects the system's core function from scrutiny.</p>

<p><strong>Neo-Absurdism</strong> begins with a simple observation: the boulder learns faster than Sisyphus does.</p>
<p>The cruelest evolution: our punishments evolve to match our capacity to endure them. We don't just suffer within systems, we optimize our own suffering until optimization itself becomes the prison. Each attempt at rebellion teaches the system how to quell rebellion.</p>

He identified three stages: first, workers lost their know-how (savoir-faire) to machines. Then consumers lost their knowledge of how to live (savoir-vivre) to marketing. Now we're losing our capacity for theoretical thinking itself (savoir-théoriser) to algorithms. Our memory has migrated into devices that remember for us.

<h2 id="iv-the-humanist-response">IV. The Humanist Response</h2>
<p>In recognizing this recursive absurdity, we find something Camus couldn't have imagined: the opportunity to embed rebellion not in the task but in the architecture of the task itself.</p>
<p>In <em>The Rebel</em>, Camus wrote that rebellion discovers its own limits - the point where it must say "thus far and no further." But what happens when you're building the very systems that oppress you? The limits aren't discovered; they must be encoded. This is our peculiar burden and our only genuine freedom: we can architect the boundaries of our own imprisonment.</p>
<p>This is <strong>Humanist Absurdism</strong>: not individual acts of coding kindness, but the recognition that our only real rebellion is each other. The systems we've built isolate us, atomize us, make us compete for optimization metrics. They feed on our separation.</p>
<p>The developer who shares salary information despite NDAs. The team that collectively refuses to implement dark patterns. These aren't only acts of compassion - they're acts of solidarity. The recursive absurd wants us alone with our individual boulders. Pushing together is the only rebellion it can't optimize away.</p>
<p>We can't destroy the machine because we are the machine. But machines are made of parts, and parts can organize. When enough components refuse to function properly, even recursive systems fail. Not through grand sabotage but through collective friction. Through the absurd insistence on remaining human together while the system demands we become algorithms alone.</p>
<p>Each compassionate constraint, each preservation of inefficient human agency - these are our acts of revolt. We cannot escape the recursive loops, but we can insert breakpoints. We cannot stop building the boulder that learns, but we can teach it mercy.</p>

            <p>Han warns that neoliberal psychopolitics eliminates negativity; the capacity to withdraw, to refuse, to say “no.” In the regime of positivity, everything must be optimized, shared, performed, liked. Resistance, then, requires the reintroduction of negativity: spaces of silence, refusal, inefficiency. To embed compassion into systems is to preserve friction, opacity, and the possibility of saying “enough” against the endless imperative of self-optimization.</p>

<p>This is neither Camus's heroic defiance nor his joyful acceptance. It is something more modest and more desperate: the attempt to remain human while building machines, to preserve what is useless and beautiful while optimizing everything else. Small choices, embedded everywhere, preserving humanity one interaction at a time.</p>

<h2 id="v-the-final-recursion">V. The Final Recursion</h2>
<p>The recursive absurd generates what Camus never faced: the erasure of the distinction between rebel and system. Rebellion itself becomes content. Every protest we make is logged, analyzed, and used to optimize future suppression of protest. </p>
<p>The system doesn't suppress rebellion anymore - it feeds on it. Every critique strengthens the algorithm. Every attempt to expose the machine becomes part of the machine. We're not just complicit; we're recursive accomplices, each act of resistance teaching the system how to resist our resistance.</p>
<p>But here, perhaps, lies an inversion Camus didn't foresee. If we are the boulder - if we've become the very weight we push - then we contain the rebellion within us. Every system we build carries, hidden in its architecture, the possibility of our transcendence. Not through destruction, but through the patient encoding of human values in inhuman systems.</p>
<p>This essay itself is part of the problem it describes. It will be indexed, analyzed, fed into language models, used to train systems that will generate better essays about recursive absurdism. The critique becomes content. The rebellion becomes product. The philosophy becomes data.</p>

            <p>Han describes transparency as the new imperative of control: the demand that everything be visible, sharable, optimized. Under psychopolitics, freedom itself is weaponized; we willingly disclose ourselves, believing we are exercising autonomy, but in doing so we deepen our subjugation. When critique itself becomes content, rebellion is not repressed but absorbed, transformed into more data for the system. The subject is not forced into obedience; it chooses obedience as if it were freedom.</p>

<p>And knowing this, I write it anyway. Because the alternative (silence) is also data. Because choosing to embed humanity into inhuman systems is the only choice that remains truly ours.</p>
<p>That's not victory. But it's not surrender either. It's acceptance, and the radical decision to remain stubbornly, compassionately human.</p>

<p>The concept of the "recursive absurd" extends Camus's framework to address algorithmic systems that Stiegler analyzed as creating "systemic stupidity" through the industrialization of memory and consciousness.</p>
<p>Han’s analysis of psychopolitics complements this by showing how neoliberal power colonizes subjectivity itself, transforming freedom into a mode of domination through voluntary transparency, self-optimization, and the erasure of negativity.</p>
