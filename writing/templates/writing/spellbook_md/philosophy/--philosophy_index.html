<p>A working collection of ideas at the intersection of technology, absurdism, and humanity.</p>
<p><a href="/writing/philosophy/the-recursive-absurd/">Essay on The Recursive Absurd</a></p>
<h2 id="the-recursive-condition">The Recursive Condition</h2>
<p>We no longer discover absurdity; we manufacture it, then optimize its production.</p>
<p>The systems we build now routinely exceed human comprehension - not as bug but as feature. We've architected our own incomprehension and called it progress. The engineer debugging yesterday's code finds it alien. The teacher uses AI to explain what they taught the AI. This isn't emergence. It's design.</p>
<p>Your boulder doesn't just roll back down anymore. It takes notes on pushing techniques, adjusts its weight distribution, then teaches other boulders. To keep up with this, you build an app to track your metrics. You sell courses on optimization. You become the boulder you push.</p>
<p>This is the recursive condition: building tools to save time we spend maintaining tools. Writing documentation about reducing documentation. Automating work to free up time for more automation. The loop closes so seamlessly we forget there was ever an outside.</p>
<h2 id="the-three-extensions-of-absurdism">The Three Extensions of Absurdism</h2>
<h3 id="humanist-absurdism">Humanist Absurdism</h3>
<p><em>The radical act of choosing compassion within dehumanizing systems</em></p>
<p>The philosophy of embedding kindness within inhuman systems. When we cannot escape the labyrinth, we can at least ensure it contains windows, gardens, and secret doors. Every line of code is a moral choice.</p>
<p><strong>Living This Philosophy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Code as Care</strong>: Every error message, every comment, every interface choice affects real humans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Business as Compassion</strong>: Teach while you build, ensure that clients understand their own systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Teaching as Resistance</strong>: Create educational content that preserves human understanding in an age of AI automation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community as Garden</strong>: Building spaces where people grow together. The Django community, Mastodon &amp; the Fediverse - these aren't just networks but gardens we tend together.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions Before Every Decision:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who does this serve? Who does it exclude?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will the person who comes after me curse me or thank me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am I adding complexity to solve a problem or to feel clever?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does this make people more capable or more dependent?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What breaks when I'm gone?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="techno-absurdism">Techno-Absurdism</h3>
<p><em>We build prisons of logic that learn to perfect themselves</em></p>
<p>The recognition that we've created systems that operate beyond human comprehension while still serving human-defined goals. We are architects of our own incomprehension, debugging processes that debug themselves.</p>
<p><strong>How This Manifests:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Toolchain Paradox:</strong> Your CMS generates views from markdown which gets parsed to HTML which gets served by a framework which renders templates. Each layer of abstraction makes development "easier" while making the system more opaque.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Framework Recursion:</strong> We build frameworks on frameworks on frameworks to manage complexity we created by building frameworks. Abstraction all the way down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Testing Loop:</strong> Your tests run on test runners that depend on packages that depend on compilers that compile to bytecode that runs on VMs. We test our tests with tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The AI Education Trap:</strong> We teach AI to help us code, which generates code we don't understand, which we need AI to explain, creating a dependency loop that strengthens with each iteration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Breaking Through:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build tools that reveal their own workings, not just their outputs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose transparency over black boxes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document not just what but why</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preserve human understanding alongside automation</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="neo-absurdism">Neo-Absurdism</h3>
<p><em>The boulder was training for building better boulders</em></p>
<p>The philosophy that we've optimized our own suffering so thoroughly that exploitation has become invisible. Rather than simply enduring the absurd - we package it, monetize it, and convince others it's self-improvement.</p>
<p><strong>The Compound Absurdity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Debt Loop:</strong> We take on debt to get credentials to get jobs to pay off the debt. The escape is the trap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Productivity Spiral:</strong> We buy tools to free up time we spend researching better tools. Optimization optimizes itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Wellness Industrial Complex:</strong> We pay people to teach us how to cope with systems they also can't escape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Content Ouroboros:</strong> We doom-scroll content about the harms of doom-scrolling. The critique becomes the product.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Living With It:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notice when you're selling your own cage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask who profits from your optimization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refuse to package your suffering as advice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes the only rebellion is refusing to monetize the rebellion</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>"We build the labyrinth that contains us. The question isn't whether to build - we must. The question is whether we build with windows, gardens, and secret doors for others to find. Every project is a choice: prison or playground, maze or garden, constraint or liberation. Choose wisely, build kindly, document thoroughly."</em></p>
