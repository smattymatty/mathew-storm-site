## Pro Tips for Dominance

2. **Use middle initials** if you have one (Mathew J. Storm) for extra differentiation
3. **Create a press kit** at /press/ with high-res photos and official bio
4. **Start a newsletter** - "Mathew Storm's Recursive Thoughts"
5. **Register mathewstorm.com** and redirect to .ca

## Emergency Disambiguation

If confusion persists, consider:
- Adding tagline: "The Thinking Mathew Storm"
- Using "Mathew Storm (Tech)" in some contexts
- Creating comparison content: "Mathew Storm vs Mathew Storms - What's the Difference?"

## Remember

You have a MASSIVE advantage: Your content (recursive absurd, 80-20 Human-in-the-Loop) is completely unique. The basketball player and comic character can't compete with your thought leadership.

**Your mantra:** Every search for "Mathew Storm" should find the developer-philosopher, not the athlete or superhero.
