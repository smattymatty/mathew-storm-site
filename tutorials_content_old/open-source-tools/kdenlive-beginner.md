# Learn Kdenlive in 20 Minutes - Free Video Editing Tutorial

You want to edit videos. You don't want to pay Adobe $30/month forever. You don't want to pirate software. And maybe DaVinci Resolve's learning curve feels a bit steep.

**Enter Kdenlive** - free, open source, and honestly? Pretty damn good.

I made this tutorial to get you editing as fast as possible. No fluff, no 45-minute introduction to the interface. We're jumping straight into editing a video from start to finish.

## Why Kdenlive?

Before we jump in, here's why I'm recommending Kdenlive:

**It's actually free.** Not "free trial then $300" or "free but missing essential features." Actually free. Forever.

**It's open source.** The code is public. No shady data collection. No rug-pulls. If you don't like something, you (or someone) can fix it.

**It works on everything.** Linux, Mac, Windows. All equally supported.

**It's powerful enough.** I've edited hour-long videos, multi-track projects, greenscreen work - all in Kdenlive. It handles way more than most people need.

**It's not trying to upsell you.** No "upgrade to Pro," no cloud subscriptions, no Adobe Creative Cloud bundle pressure.

---

## What You'll Learn

In the video above, I walk through:

1. **Interface basics** - What you're looking at and where things are
2. **Importing footage** - Getting your clips into the project
3. **Cutting and trimming** - The 80% of editing you'll actually do
4. **Transitions** - Making cuts less jarring (but don't overuse them)
5. **Audio editing** - Volume, fade in/out, basic cleanup
6. **Adding text/titles** - For intros, captions, whatever
7. **Exporting** - Getting your finished video out

That's it. No 15-minute intro about "what is video editing." We just do it.

## Who This Is For

**You should watch this if:**
- You're new to video editing entirely
- You're switching from Adobe/Final Cut and want something free
- You're on Linux and need a solid editor
- You're tired of subscription models
- You just need to edit some damn videos without a PhD

**You probably don't need this if:**
- You're already comfortable in Kdenlive (though you might pick up a tip or two)
- You need Hollywood-level color grading and VFX (use DaVinci Resolve)
- You're editing on a potato computer from 2008 (Kdenlive needs decent specs)

---

## Quick Tips Before You Start

### 1. Download Kdenlive
Get it from [kdenlive.org](https://kdenlive.org) - available for Linux, Mac, and Windows.

**Linux users:** It's probably in your package manager. Just `apt install kdenlive` or equivalent.

### 2. Your Computer Needs to Be Decent
Video editing is resource-intensive. You'll want:
- At least 8GB RAM (16GB is better)
- A modern CPU (anything from the last 5 years)
- Actual hard drive space for your footage

### 3. Organize Your Files
Before you even open Kdenlive, put all your footage in one folder. Trust me. You'll thank yourself later.

### 4. Start Simple
Your first project shouldn't be a feature film. Edit a 2-minute video. Get comfortable with the basics. Then get fancy.

### 5. Save Often
Kdenlive auto-saves, but Ctrl+S is your friend. Use it.

## The 80/20 of Video Editing

Here's what I've learned after years of editing:

**80% of editing is just cutting clips.** That's it. Import footage, drag to timeline, cut out the bad parts. Most videos don't need fancy effects.

**10% is audio.** Making sure people can hear you and the levels are reasonable. Audio quality matters more than you think.

**10% is everything else.** Transitions, color grading, effects, titles. Nice to have, but most videos work fine without them.

Focus on getting the basics down. The fancy stuff can wait.

---

## Common Beginner Mistakes

**Too many transitions.** Every cut doesn't need a dissolve or wipe. Most professional videos use straight cuts 90% of the time. Transitions should be intentional, not decorative.

**Music too loud.** Your background music should be in the *background*. If viewers can't hear you talking over the music, it's too loud.

**Overusing effects.** That cool glitch effect is neat the first time. The tenth time? Distracting. Less is more.

**Not watching the full video before export.** Scrubbing through the timeline isn't the same as watching it play. Watch your whole video before you render it.

**Rendering at weird settings.** Unless you have a specific reason, just use: MP4 container, H.264 codec, 1920x1080, 30fps. It'll work everywhere.

---

## Beyond the Basics

Once you're comfortable with what's in the video, here's what to learn next:

**Keyframes** - Animate position, scale, opacity over time. Essential for more dynamic videos.

**Color correction** - Make your footage look consistent and professional. Kdenlive has decent color tools.

**Greenscreen/chroma key** - Remove backgrounds, composite footage. Kdenlive handles this surprisingly well.

**Speed ramping** - Slow motion, time lapses, speed changes. Great for dramatic effect.

**Multi-track audio** - Music, dialogue, sound effects all balanced properly.

I might make tutorials on these eventually. Or just experiment and Google things as you go. That's how most people learn.

## Why This Video Is on NorthTube

You might notice this video isn't hosted on YouTube. It's on [NorthTube](https://northtube.ca) - a PeerTube instance I run.

**Why?**
- No ads interrupting the tutorial
- No algorithm deciding if you should see it
- No tracking your viewing habits
- Community-funded, not advertiser-funded
- I control the platform instead of the platform controlling me

## Download Kdenlive Assets (Optional)

Want to follow along with the exact footage I used in the tutorial?

**[Download practice assets](#)** *(coming soon)*

Or just use your own footage - phone videos, screen recordings, whatever. The principles are the same.

## Final Thoughts

Kdenlive isn't perfect. The UI can be a bit clunky. Rendering is sometimes slower than commercial editors. Certain features are buried in menus.

But it's free, it's powerful, and it's not trying to extract maximum value from you as a user.

For most people editing YouTube videos, tutorials, vlogs, or personal projects? **Kdenlive is more than enough.**

Stop waiting for the "right" editor. Just start editing.
