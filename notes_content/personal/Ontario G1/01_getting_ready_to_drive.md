## Know your Vehicle
Every vehicle had different controls and assistance available to drivers such as four-wheel-drive, ABS, traction control and fuel ignition systems. Be aware of how all the controls work and what the instrument panel is telling you. Make sure that all the appropriate gauges and warning lights are in working order.

{~ card title="Essential Controls Check" footer="Practice without looking away from the road." ~}
You should be familiar enough with the controls to be able to operate the following without looking:

* Windshield wipers and washers
* Defrosting controls and heater
* Headlights, including switching between high and low beams
{~~}

## Get into Position
It is important to sit correctly when driving. You must be able to see clearly beyond the steering wheel and hood. Make sure you can see the ground a maximum of 4 meters ahead of you.

You should be sitting up straight and your hands should be able to reach the steering wheel with a slight bend in your elbows. You should also move your seat forward or back to access the pedals easily. If you can put your feet flat on the floor below the brake pedal with no stretching, that indicates a good position.

{~ alert type="info" title="Crash Protection" ~}
It is important to adjust your headrest to be directly behind the back of your head for crash protection.

## Keep a clear view
{~ alert type="warning" title="Obstructed Windows are Illegal" ~}
Make sure you have a clear view all around when you are on the road. Do not put any material on your windows that could prevent you from seeing clearly. Additionally, you mustn't put anything on your windshield or front windows that would prevent someone from seeing in.
{~~}

## Find your Blind Spots
Blindspots are the areas around your vehicle that you can't see in your mirrors. They may obscure pedestrians or cyclists; they could even hide other vehicles. They usually exist on the left and right hand side towards the back of your vehicle.

{~ accordion title="How to Set Your Mirrors Correctly" ~}
1.  **Interior Mirror:** Adjust your interior mirror to reflect the middle of your rear window so that you can see directly behind you.
2.  **Side Mirrors:** The left- and right-hand mirrors should be positioned so you can just see the back of your vehicle when you lean towards them.
3.  **Goal:** Try not to have the same view in more than one mirror so that you cover the largest area possible.

### Test Your Blind Spots
Have a friend or family member walk completely around your car while you sit in the driver's seat. Monitor them using only your mirrors and take note of the areas where they disappear from view. The best way to deal with these blind spots while driving is to perform a quick shoulder check before turning or changing lanes.

## Fasten your seatbelt
Seatbelts are vital for preventing injuries and fatalities in the event of a crash. Every driver and passenger should have their own seatbelt properly fastened, and children should be in car seats or booster seats.

{~ alert type="danger" title="Penalties for Not Wearing a Seatbelt" ~}
Not using your seatbelt can result in a fine and two demerit points on your license. You can also be sanctioned with fines and demerit points if you have a passenger under 16 not wearing a seatbelt.
{~~}

{~ alert type="warning" title="Rules for G1 and Novice Drivers" ~}
If you are a Level One (G1) driver, the only person allowed as a passenger in your front seat is your accompanying driver, who must wear a seatbelt. Novice drivers who drive vehicles without a working seatbelt for every passenger will forfeit their license for a minimum of 30 days.
{~~}

{~ card title="How to Properly Wear a Seatbelt" ~}
* A seatbelt should only restrain one person.
* The upper strap goes over the shoulder.
* The lap strap should be worn low on the hips.
* It should be tight enough to ensure you remain in your seat in a crash.
* Airbags are designed to work *with* seatbelts, not replace them.
{~~}

## Child Safety
Depending on how tall they are, what they weigh, and their age, every child in a vehicle needs a seatbelt, a booster seat, or a child car seat. The driver has responsibility for making sure any passenger below 16 years old is properly secured.

{~ accordion title="Infants (Under 9kg / 20lbs)" ~}
Any infant weighing below 9kg (20lbs) must be restrained in an approved, rear-facing car seat. The seat should rest at a 45-degree angle. There should be less than 2.5cm of play when you move the seat.
{~~}

{~ accordion title="Toddlers (9kg - 18kg / 20-40lbs)" ~}
Children between 9kg and 18kg (20-40lbs) must have a child seat that has a tether strap attached to the tether anchor of the vehicle.
{~~}

{~ accordion title="Preschool / Primary Age" ~}
Any child who does not fit into a forward-facing car seat must use a booster seat if they are below 145cm (4'9") in height and weigh between 18kg (40lbs) and 36kg (80lbs).
{~~}

{~ alert type="danger" title="Airbag and Child Safety Warning" ~}
Never put a child in a seat with an active airbag in front of it. Wherever possible, children under the age of 13 should be seated in the rear of the vehicle.
{~~}

## Turn on headlights at night and in poor conditions
Headlights help you see in dark or low visibility conditions and let other road users see you.

{~ card title="Lighting System Requirements" ~}
* **Headlights:** Must project white light visible from 150m and illuminate objects 110m away.
* **Rear Lights:** Must be red and visible from 150m.
* **License Plate Light:** A white light must illuminate the rear license plate whenever headlights are on.
{~~}

{~ alert type="info" title="When to Use Headlights" ~}
Headlights must be turned on 30 minutes before sunset and remain on until 30 minutes after sunrise. They must also be used any time you cannot clearly see people or vehicles from 150m away.
{~~}

{~ accordion title="Rules for Using High Beams" ~}
* You must switch to low beams when an oncoming vehicle is within 150m of you.
* You must switch to low beams when you are within 60m of a vehicle ahead of you (in the same direction) that you do not intend to pass.
* These rules apply on all roads, including those with dividers.
{~~}

{~ alert type="warning" title="Driving with Faulty or Improper Lights" ~}
You should never drive if any element of your lighting system is faulty. Always ensure your lights are clean. Never drive using only your parking lights; they are for parking. Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) are only for use in good daytime conditions; use low beams for better visibility if your vehicle lacks DRLs.
