## Steer Smoothly
You should practice steering your vehicle as smoothly and precisely as possible. In normal circumstances, you should keep both hands on the wheel.

{~ card title="Steering Best Practices" ~}
* **Hand Position:** Keep both hands on the wheel, positioned at 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock.
* **Practice Stability:** Practice steering in a straight line while performing other actions, such as changing gears, checking over your shoulder, or using vehicle controls.
{~~}

## Use of turn signals and brake lights
Your brake lights and turn signals should be used to show other drivers what you are doing. Always give your signals well in advance.

{~ alert type="info" title="When to Signal" ~}
Signal your intent when you plan to:
* Stop or slow down
* Turn
* Switch lanes
* Drive away from a parking space
* Leave the road
{~~}

{~ accordion title="What if my signals are not working? (Hand Signals)" ~}
If your lights are not working you can indicate your intentions with these hand signals from the driver's side window:
* **Turn Left:** Hold your left arm out horizontally.
* **Turn Right:** Hold your left arm out, bent at a 90-degree angle with your hand pointing up.
* **Slow Down or Stop:** Hold your left arm out, pointing down towards the ground.
{~~}

## Keep Right
{~ alert type="info" title="Rule of the Road: Keep Right" ~}
On a single-lane road, you should always keep to the right of the road. On a multi-lane road, you should stick to the right-hand lane unless you are turning left or overtaking other vehicles. You should be particularly careful about driving to the right if you wish to drive slower than other traffic.
{~~}

## Obey Speed Limits
Never go faster than the maximum speed limit, but remember it is a maximum not a target. Make sure that you can stop safely at all times; don't drive at the maximum speed if the weather is bad, traffic is heavy, or you are in a school/construction zone.

{~ alert type="info" title="Default Speed Limits" ~}
If no speed limit is posted, the maximum speed is:
* **50 km/h** in a city, town, or village.
* **80 km/h** everywhere else.
{~~}

{~ alert type="warning" title="When Not to Use Cruise Control" ~}
You should not use cruise control in the following conditions:
* On roads that are slippery with ice or rain.
* In congested traffic areas.
* If you are tired.
{~~}

{~ alert type="danger" title="Illegal Devices" ~}
It is against the law to have any device that alerts you to the presence of police radar guns and other speed-measuring equipment. You can expect to be given a fine and demerit points if you are found using one.
{~~}

## Obey the Police
{~ alert type="danger" title="Police Instructions are Supreme" ~}
Instructions from police officers take precedence over all other traffic signals and signs.
{~~}

If you are instructed to pull over by a police officer, you must stop your vehicle as far to the right as is safely possible. Do not leave your vehicle; wait for the officer to come to you.

{~ card title="Required Documents" footer="Failure to produce can result in penalties" ~}
If the police officer asks for them, you must show:
1.  Proof of insurance
2.  Your vehicle permit
3.  Your driver's license
{~~}

Failing to pull over when instructed to can result in fines, license suspensions, or even a prison sentence.

## Maintaining Space
In normal circumstances, try to drive at the same speed as the traffic you are in. You should try to leave a space cushion all around your vehicle to give other drivers the best chance of seeing you and to avoid collisions.

If you are driving behind another vehicle, you must leave enough space to allow you to make a safe stop if it should suddenly stop.

{~ practice difficulty="Beginner" timeframe="2 seconds" impact="High" focus="Following Distance" ~}
### The Two-Second Rule
This is the absolute minimum following distance in good conditions. To check your distance:
1.  Look up the road and pick a static point (e.g., a streetlight or postbox).
2.  When the back of the vehicle ahead passes this point, begin counting.
3.  The front of your vehicle should not reach that same point for at least two seconds.
{~~}

{~ alert type="warning" title="Increase Your Following Distance" ~}
A two-second following distance is the minimum for good conditions. You must leave more space in low light, in bad weather, when carrying a heavy load, or when following a motorcycle (as they can brake in a shorter distance).
