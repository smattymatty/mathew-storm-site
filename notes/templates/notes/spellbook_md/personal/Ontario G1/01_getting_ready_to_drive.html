<p>Every vehicle had different controls and assistance available to drivers such as four-wheel-drive, ABS, traction control and fuel ignition systems. Be aware of how all the controls work and what the instrument panel is telling you. Make sure that all the appropriate gauges and warning lights are in working order.</p>

<h2 id="get-into-position">Get into Position</h2>
<p>It is important to sit correctly when driving. You must be able to see clearly beyond the steering wheel and hood. Make sure you can see the ground a maximum of 4 meters ahead of you.</p>
<p>You should be sitting up straight and your hands should be able to reach the steering wheel with a slight bend in your elbows. You should also move your seat forward or back to access the pedals easily. If you can put your feet flat on the floor below the brake pedal with no stretching, that indicates a good position.</p>
