<h2 id="maintaining-space">Maintaining Space</h2>
<p>In normal circumstances, try to drive at the same speed as the traffic you are in. You should try to leave a space cushion all around your vehicle to give other drivers the best chance of seeing you and to avoid collisions. If you are driving behind another vehicle, you must leave enough space to allow you to make a safe stop if it should suddenly stop.</p>

<p>This means you should have a "following distance" of at least two seconds, which is the absolute minimum in good conditions. To check your distance:<br />
1.  Look up the road and pick a static point (e.g a streetlight or postbox).<br />
2.  When the back of the vehicle ahead reaches this point, begin counting.<br />
3.  The front of your vehicle should not reach that same point for at least two seconds.</p>

        <p>You must leave more space than the two-second minimum if you are driving in low light or bad weather, or carrying a heavy load. Remember that motorcycles can brake in a shorter distance than cars, so leave more distance when following them.</p>
