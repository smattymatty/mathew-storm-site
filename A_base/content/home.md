## üöÄ My Mission: Change the World

I'm not just building software - I'm building a future where:
- **Technology empowers humans**, not replaces them
- **Canada leads in digital sovereignty** and ethical AI
- **Every person has tech literacy** as a fundamental right
- **AI serves humanity** with wisdom, integrity, and compassion

## üõ†Ô∏è What I'm Building

### Storm Development Trinity
Founded with **Jacob Kellum** and **Ellyanna Roseboom**, we're creating:
- **Digital transformation** for small businesses
- **Human-centered AI tools** that teach while they automate
- **MIDAS toolchain** for rapid, ethical development
- **Educational platforms** like EduLite for global access

### Open Source Leadership

#### üî• Flagship Tools of the Movement

**[Django Mercury](https://github.com/80-20-Human-In-The-Loop/Django-Mercury-Performance-Testing)** ‚≠ê Most Popular  
Performance testing that teaches while it tests. Three modes: Student (learn), Expert (speed), Agent (CI/CD).  
*"Test Django app speed. Learn why it's slow. Fix it."*

**[Storm Checker](https://github.com/Storm-Developments/storm-checker)**  
Type safety that makes you better, not dependent. Educational mode for learning, JSON mode for automation.  
*"Because developers should understand the types they use."*

**[Django Spellbook](https://github.com/smattymatty/django_spellbook)**  
The framework powering this very site. Markdown-first Django with built-in design system.  
*"Making Django development magical through simplicity."*

**[80-20 Community Hub](https://github.com/80-20-Human-In-The-Loop/Community)**  
The heart of our movement. Philosophy, tools, and values for human-centered AI development.  
*"Where wisdom, compassion, and integrity meet artificial intelligence."*

## üá®üá¶ Digital Sovereignty Activist

I fight for Canada's digital independence through:

### ü¶£ The Great Mastodon Migration
Leading the charge to move people off "Oligarch Platforms" onto decentralized networks like Mastodon. The Django community inspired me to join - now I'm working to normalize these open alternatives for everyone.

### üêç Django for Canadian Sovereignty
Django isn't just a framework - it's a tool for digital independence. Open source technology lets Canada build its own infrastructure without dependence on foreign tech giants.

### üçÅ DjangoCon Canada Vision
Advocating for a Canadian DjangoCon that reflects our values of safety, inclusion, and openness. A conference where ALL developers can participate without fear.

**Core Fights:**
- **Tech literacy** as a human right for all Canadians
- **Decentralized networks** replacing corporate social media
- **Open source adoption** in government and education
- **Safe spaces** for tech communities to gather and grow

## üìñ The Author & Philosopher

Heavily inspired by Camus, I'm developing **Humanist Absurdism** - a philosophy for the age of artificial intelligence. My fictional opus, **"The Labyrinth of Sisyphus,"** reimagines the absurd hero as a coder eternally debugging the universe.

*"In an age of algorithmic cruelty, our most radical act is choosing to remain human."*

Technology represents an existential threat that philosophers of old would have quivered at. Today, we must face this. The machine learns from our data, but we must learn from our compassion.

**[‚Üí Explore My Philosophical Musings](/philo/intro/)**  
Dive into Humanist Absurdism, Techno-Absurdism, and Neo-Absurdism through the lens of "The Labyrinth of Sisyphus."

## üí° The Philosophy

As leader of the 80-20 Human-In-The-Loop community, I believe in:
- **80% AI Automation** - Let machines handle repetitive work
- **20% Human Oversight** - Humans make critical decisions
- **100% Human Responsibility** - We own the outcomes

*"We don't need more coders. We need tech-philosophers."*

## üìö Current Learning & Teaching

I'm often:
- **Teaching** creating educational content and mentoring students
- **Studying** C & Linux at Seneca Polytechnic (because fundamentals matter)
- **Building** the next generation of tech philosophers
- **Writing** about the intersection of technology and humanity

{~ card title="Why Sisyphus?" footer="The Eternal Struggle of Progress" ~}
Like Sisyphus pushing his boulder up the mountain, I push code, ideas, and humanity forward every day. But unlike Sisyphus, I'm not condemned to this task - I've chosen it.

Every line of code is a moral choice. Every algorithm encodes values. Every AI deployment affects human lives. This is the boulder I push: ensuring technology serves human flourishing.

The struggle isn't punishment - it's purpose. And I wouldn't have it any other way.

{~ accordion title="üåü The Storm Development Story" ~}
Storm Development is a digital enablement agency founded by three visionaries:
- **Mathew Storm** (me) - The tech philosopher and architect
- **Jacob Kellum** - The systems wizard and performance guru  
- **Ellyanna Roseboom** - The design sage and user advocate

Together, we're not just building websites - we're enabling digital transformation for businesses while preserving human agency and wisdom.
{~~}

{~ accordion title="ü§ù The 80-20 Human-In-The-Loop Movement" ~}
I founded this movement because I saw a dangerous trend: developers becoming dependent on AI, losing the ability to understand and fix their own code. This isn't just about productivity - it's about preserving human skills in an age of artificial intelligence.

**The Core Philosophy:**
- **80% AI Automation**: Let AI handle repetitive, pattern-matching work
- **20% Human Oversight**: Humans make architectural and ethical decisions
- **100% Human Responsibility**: We always own the outcomes

**Why This Matters:**
We're at a crossroads. We can choose full AI automation and lose human expertise, or we can choose the 80-20 approach where AI enhances human capability instead of replacing it.

*"You can only vibe code problems that have already been solved. True innovation requires human wisdom."*

**Our Impact:**
- **Django Mercury**: Downloaded by thousands, teaching performance optimization while testing
- **Educational Tools**: Every tool teaches concepts, not just solutions
- **Global Community**: Developers worldwide learning to work WITH AI, not under it

Join us at [80-20 Human-In-The-Loop](https://github.com/80-20-Human-In-The-Loop/Community) to help build a future where human wisdom, compassion, and integrity remain at the heart of technology.

*"The future is not human vs AI. It's human WITH AI, thoughtfully balanced."*

{~ accordion title="ü¶£ The Great Mastodon Migration" ~}
I'm leading efforts to normalize decentralized social networks and move people away from "Oligarch Platforms."

**The Challenge:**
Developers understand the importance of open source immediately. But how do we convince the average person to leave platforms with Reels, Stories, and Marketplaces?

**My Strategy:**
- Show how the Django community thrives on Mastodon
- Demonstrate that influencers can rebuild their base on open networks
- Create content that makes decentralization appealing, not technical
- Build bridges for communities to migrate together, not alone

**Why It Matters:**
Digital sovereignty isn't just about code - it's about where we gather, share ideas, and build community. Mastodon represents the future of social networking: open, federated, and owned by users, not oligarchs.

{~ accordion title="üéØ My Vision for Canada's Digital Future" ~}
As a political activist in tech literacy and digital sovereignty, I'm working to ensure Canada leads the world in:

- **Ethical AI development** that respects human rights
- **Digital literacy programs** for all Canadians
- **Open source initiatives** that reduce foreign tech dependence
- **Tech policies** that empower citizens, not corporations
- **Safe tech conferences** like a future DjangoCon Canada

We have the talent, the values, and the vision. Now we need the will to act.

*"Canada's values align perfectly with the Django community - it's time for DjangoCon Canada where ALL developers can participate without fear."*
{~~}

{~ accordion title="‚ö° Django Mercury - Our Flagship Tool" ~}
Django Mercury started at EduLite when we discovered a view making 325 database queries for one page! But instead of just fixing it, we built a tool that teaches developers WHY it's slow and HOW to fix it.

**Three Modes for Three Audiences:**
- **üéì Student Mode**: Educational output with quizzes and tutorials
- **üíº Expert Mode**: Concise results for professionals
- **ü§ñ Agent Mode**: Structured JSON for CI/CD integration

**Real Impact:**
- Grades performance from S (perfect) to F (failing)
- Detects N+1 queries and explains them in context
- Tracks progress and gamifies learning
- Preserves human understanding while automating detection

*"Mercury doesn't just find problems - it teaches you to understand them."*

{~ accordion title="üìö The Labyrinth of Sisyphus - My Fictional Opus" ~}
A 50-chapter novel reimagining Sisyphus as a coder condemned to eternally debug the labyrinth that holds the Minotaur. Working alongside Daedalus, he transforms his curse into purpose.

**The Philosophy:**
Through **Humanist Absurdism**, I explore how we find meaning in an age where algorithms threaten to replace human wisdom. Sisyphus chooses compassion in a system designed for cruelty, embedding hope into the very architecture of oppression.

**Key Themes:**
- The transformation of punishment into purpose
- Finding freedom in the space between bug and fix
- The radical act of remaining human in algorithmic systems
- The happy Sisyphus who finds joy in eternal debugging

*"One must imagine Sisyphus coding - and finding perfect freedom in that moment between problem and solution."*

The novel serves as a metaphor for modern tech workers: eternally maintaining systems of questionable morality, yet finding ways to embed kindness into the code itself.
