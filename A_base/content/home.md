About Me (Thursday, May 22nd, 2025)
{~~}

{~ accordion title="What am I doing now?" ~}
I am currently working on [Django Spellbook](https://pypi.org/project/django-spellbook/) which is a tool for building websites by parsing Markdown files with embedded `SpellBlock` components.

**This website is built with** `Django Spellbook`. It is perfect for a developer's portfolio, blog, or documentation site.

As long as you have some Markdown files, and you're willing to learn `Spellbook Markdown Syntax`, you can create a beautiful and interactive website.

{~ accordion title="What am I learning?" ~}
I am currently going to school at [Seneca Polytechnic](https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/home.html) in Toronto, Canada.

I am studying part-time as I work full-time in retail. Last semester, I took two classes. This semester, I will be taking one class.

I am learning `C` at the moment, in the IPC144 course.
{~~}

{~ accordion title="Why am I doing this?" ~}
Because I am very passionate about open source and education.

I want to help people learn new things and build cool things.

I also want to help myself by learning new things, I believe that the best way to learn is to teach others.
