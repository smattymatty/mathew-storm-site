## About

Open source engineer focused on federated systems, self-hosted infrastructure, and tools that put control back in users' hands. Creating Django-based solutions for organizations that value transparency, sovereignty, and the open web.

Canadian developer active on the Fediverse, building alternatives to centralized platforms.

## Writing

I write about the intersection of technology and philosophy, particularly around digital sovereignty, the federated web, and what it means to build human-centered infrastructure.

Exploring themes like recursive absurdism, techno-absurdism, and how we can create technology that respects human agency rather than extracting from it.

## What I Believe

The federated social web is the future. Self-hosted infrastructure isn't just for hobbyists - it's how organizations maintain sovereignty and transparency.

WASM and ActivityPub are changing what's possible. We can build powerful, distributed systems without surrendering control to platforms.

Technology and philosophy are inseparable. The tools we build encode values. I'm building tools that encode sovereignty, transparency, and respect for human agency.
