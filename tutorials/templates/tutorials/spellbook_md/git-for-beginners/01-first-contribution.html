<h1>Git: A Distributed Version Control System</h1>
<p>Git is a powerful version control tool. Its key functions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distributed VCS:</strong> Tracks all file changes, supporting parallel work. Full local copies offer speed and offline use.</li>
<li><strong>Change Tracking:</strong> Saves all modifications as <strong>commits</strong> (project snapshots) for easy history review and rollbacks.</li>
<li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Employs <strong>branching</strong> for isolated development and <strong>merging</strong> to integrate changes, managing conflicts.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive History:</strong> Logs detailed information for every commit (who, when, why), vital for audits and debugging.</li>
<li><strong>Offline Functionality:</strong> Most operations are performed <strong>locally and quickly</strong>; internet is only needed to share or fetch updates (push/pull).</li>
</ul>

        <p><strong>Git installation varies by OS:</strong><br />
Getting Git onto your computer is the first hands-on step, and the method differs slightly based on your operating system. Here's a brief rundown of the most common ways:</p>
    </span>
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Windows:</strong> The most straightforward method is typically to download the official installer directly from the <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/win">Git SCM website (https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)</a>. This installer often includes "Git Bash," a terminal environment that provides a Linux-like command-line experience for using Git on Windows.</li>
<li><strong>Mac:</strong> If you use Homebrew (a popular package manager for macOS), installing Git can be as simple as running the command <code>brew install git</code>. Alternatively, installers are also available, sometimes bundled with Xcode developer tools or directly from the <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/mac">Git SCM website (https://git-scm.com/downloads/mac)</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Linux:</strong> Installation is typically handled through your distribution's built-in package manager. For example:<ul>
<li>On <strong>Ubuntu/Debian</strong> based systems, you'll use <code>sudo apt install git</code>.</li>
<li>On <strong>Fedora</strong>, the command is <code>sudo dnf install git</code>.</li>
<li>On <strong>Arch Linux</strong>, you would use <code>sudo pacman -S git</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

            ‚úÖ

    </span>
    <span class="sb-alert-content">
        <p><strong>Good news: Once installed, Git commands are identical across all platforms:</strong></p>
<p>This is a fantastic aspect of Git! While the initial setup might differ, the core Git commands you will learn and use (<code>git commit</code>, <code>git branch</code>, <code>git checkout</code>, <code>git push</code>, <code>git pull</code>, etc.) are exactly the same whether you're on Windows, macOS, or any Linux distribution.</p>
<p>This universality means the skills you develop are highly transferable, and you can collaborate seamlessly with others who might be using different operating systems.</p>
    </span>
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>All terminal commands in this course work the same on Windows, Mac, and Linux:</strong><ul>
<li>To ensure a consistent learning experience, this course will focus on these universal Git commands as executed in a terminal or command-line interface.</li>
<li>While the terminal application itself might have a different name or appearance (e.g., Git Bash or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS, various terminal emulators on Linux), the underlying Git commands you type and their behavior will be consistent with what's taught.</li>
</ul>

    </span>
    <span class="sb-alert-content">
        <p><strong>GUI clients available for all platforms if preferred:</strong></p>
<p>If you're not entirely comfortable with the command line, or if you prefer a more visual way to interact with Git, there's good news: numerous Graphical User Interface (GUI) clients are available for all major operating systems. These tools provide a visual interface for Git operations.</p>
<p>While these GUI clients can be helpful, especially for visualizing branches and history, this course will primarily focus on the command-line interface to ensure you build a fundamental understanding of Git's operations, which are consistent everywhere.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Universally Available:</strong> Works on all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).</li>
<li><strong>Consistent Commands:</strong> The Git commands you learn are the same everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Full Power &amp; Control:</strong> Provides access to all of Git's features and is great for scripting complex workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Often Preferred by Pros:</strong> Many experienced developers favor the CLI for its speed, precision, and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Clients:</strong><br />
<em>(Examples: GitHub Desktop, Sourcetree, GitKraken, VS Code's integrated Git panel)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual Interaction:</strong> Offers a graphical way to see your repository's history, branches, and changes.</li>
<li><strong>Potentially Easier for Beginners:</strong> The visual nature can make initial Git concepts less intimidating for some.</li>
<li><strong>Varying Feature Access:</strong> While user-friendly, some GUIs might not expose all of Git's advanced commands or options directly.</li>
<li><strong>Behind the Scenes:</strong> GUI tools are essentially user-friendly interfaces that execute standard Git commands for you.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Authenticating with GitHub</h1>
<div class="sb-alert sb-alert-info sb-p-3 sb-border-radius-lg sb-mb-3 sb-shadow-sm ">

    </span>
    <span class="sb-alert-content">
        <p>It's important to distinguish: <code>git config user.name</code> and <code>git config user.email</code> set your <em>author identity</em> for commits. This is different from <em>authenticating</em> with GitHub, which is required when you interact with remote repositories (like pushing your commits or cloning private ones). Authentication proves to GitHub that you have permission to perform these actions.</p>
    </span>
</div>

<p>When you <code>push</code> to or <code>pull</code> from GitHub, especially with private repositories or when pushing to your forks, GitHub needs to verify who you are. Here are the common methods to authenticate:</p>
<div class="sb-card sb-border sb-border-radius-lg sb-shadow-sm sb-transition sb-mb-3 sb-bg-light ">

        <div class="sb-card-header sb-p-2 sb-bold">
            <h5 class="sb-card-title">üîë GitHub Authentication Options</h5>
        </div>

    <div class="sb-card-body sb-p-3">
        <p>Here are three primary ways to authenticate your Git operations with GitHub:</p>
<h3 id="option-1-https-with-a-personal-access-token-pat">Option 1: HTTPS with a Personal Access Token (PAT)</h3>
<p>This method uses the familiar HTTPS URLs for your repositories but replaces your account password with a more secure Personal Access Token (PAT). PATs are revocable, can have specific scopes (permissions), and are the recommended way to authenticate for Git over HTTPS.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>How to Get and Use a PAT:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Generate on GitHub:</strong> Navigate to your GitHub settings:<ul>
<li>Click your profile picture (top-right) ‚Üí Settings.</li>
<li>In the left sidebar, scroll down to Developer settings.</li>
<li>Go to Personal access tokens ‚Üí <strong>Tokens (classic)</strong> or <strong>Fine-grained tokens</strong>.</li>
<li>Click "Generate new token".</li>
<li>Give it a descriptive name, set an expiration, and select the necessary scopes (e.g., <code>repo</code> for full control of private repositories).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Copy Your Token:</strong> After creating the token, <strong>copy it immediately</strong>. GitHub will not show it to you again for security reasons. Store it securely (like in a password manager).</li>
<li><strong>Use When Prompted:</strong> When Git (over HTTPS) asks for your username and password:<ul>
<li>Enter your GitHub username.</li>
<li>For the password, paste your <strong>Personal Access Token</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optional: Caching Your PAT (Credential Helper)</strong><br />
    To avoid entering your PAT every time, Git can cache it.<br />
    On your command line, you can tell Git to store credentials:<br />
<code>git config --global credential.helper store</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
    </div>

        <div class="sb-card-footer sb-p-2">
            Choose the method that aligns with your security preferences and workflow.
        </div>

</div>

<div class="sb-alert sb-alert-warning sb-p-3 sb-border-radius-lg sb-mb-3 sb-shadow-sm ">
    <span class="sb-alert-icon">

            ‚ö†Ô∏è

    </span>
    <span class="sb-alert-content">
        <p>The <code>store</code> helper saves your credentials (including your PAT) in <strong>plain text</strong> on your computer. While convenient, this is not the most secure option. Modern Git installations on macOS and Windows often default to more secure helpers (<code>osxkeychain</code> or <code>manager-core</code>/<code>wincred</code>). Linux users might use <code>libsecret</code> or <code>cache</code> (which has a timeout). It's worth checking your Git setup or configuring a more secure credential helper if <code>store</code> is the default and you're concerned.</p>
    </span>
</div>

<h3>Option 2: SSH Keys (Recommended) üåü</h3>
<p>Using SSH provides a more secure and often more convenient way to interact with GitHub without needing to enter your username or PAT repeatedly. You generate an SSH key pair (a public key and a private key) on your computer. You add the public key to your GitHub account, and your private key authenticates you automatically.</p>
<div class="sb-alert sb-alert-success sb-p-3 sb-border-radius-lg sb-mb-3 sb-shadow-sm ">
    <span class="sb-alert-icon">

            ‚úÖ

    </span>
    <span class="sb-alert-content">
        <p>Once set up, SSH authentication is seamless for <code>git push</code>, <code>git pull</code>, <code>git clone</code>, etc. It uses strong cryptography and avoids password/token prompts for each operation.</p>
    </span>
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Steps to Use SSH:</strong><ol>
<li><strong>Generate SSH Key (if you don't have one):</strong><br />
    Open your terminal and run:<br />
<code>`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`</code><br />
    (Replace <code>"your_email@example.com"</code> with your GitHub email. Press Enter to accept default file locations and optionally set a passphrase for extra security.)</li>
<li><strong>Add Public Key to GitHub:</strong><ul>
<li>Copy the content of your <strong>public</strong> SSH key file. This is usually located at <code>~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code> (or <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> for older keys). You can display it with <code>cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code>.</li>
<li>On GitHub: Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG keys ‚Üí Click "New SSH key" or "Add SSH key".</li>
<li>Give it a title (e.g., "My Laptop") and paste your copied public key into the "Key" field.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Use SSH URLs for Repositories:</strong><ul>
<li>When cloning, use the SSH URL format: <code>`git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YourProject.git`</code></li>
<li>If you have an existing repository cloned via HTTPS, you can change its remote URL:<br />
<code>`git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YourProject.git`</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Option 3: GitHub CLI (gh)</h3>
<p>GitHub's official command-line tool, <code>gh</code>, can simplify authentication and many other GitHub interactions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Installation:</strong> Download and install <code>gh</code> from <a href="https://cli.github.com">cli.github.com</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Once installed, run:<br />
<code>`gh auth login`</code><br />
    This command will guide you through an interactive process (usually involving your web browser) to authenticate <code>gh</code> and, optionally, configure Git to use <code>gh</code> for authenticating HTTPS operations.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Cloning Your Fork &amp; Connecting Upstream</h1>
<p>After you've successfully forked a repository (like <code>EduLite</code>) on GitHub, the next step is to bring a copy of <strong>your fork</strong> to your local computer. This process is called "cloning." Once cloned, you'll also want to establish a link back to the original project repository. This allows you to fetch updates and keep your work aligned with the main project.</p>

        <div class="sb-card-header sb-p-2 sb-bold">

    <div class="sb-card-body sb-p-3">
        <p>First, navigate in your terminal to the directory on your computer where you want to store your project. Then, use one of the following <code>git clone</code> commands. Your choice depends on whether you've set up GitHub authentication via HTTPS (with a Personal Access Token - PAT) or SSH keys.</p>
<p><strong>A. Using HTTPS (if authenticating with a PAT):</strong><br />
Remember to replace <code>YOUR_USERNAME</code> with your actual GitHub username.<br />
<code>`git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/EduLite.git`</code></p>
<p><strong>B. Using SSH (Recommended, if you've set up SSH keys):</strong><br />
Replace <code>YOUR_USERNAME</code> with your GitHub username.<br />
<code>`git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/EduLite.git`</code></p>

    <div class="sb-card-body sb-p-3">
        <p>After cloning your fork, it's a crucial best practice to add a remote connection to the <em>original project repository</em>. This remote is conventionally named <code>upstream</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Navigate into Your Cloned Project Directory:</strong><br />
    If you're not already there, change into the directory Git just created:<br />
    (Replace <code>EduLite</code> if your project folder has a different name)<br />
<code>`cd EduLite`</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add the <code>upstream</code> Remote:</strong><br />
    You'll need the URL of the original project you forked from. For the <code>EduLite</code> example, the original is <code>https://github.com/ibrahim-sisar/EduLite.git</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Using HTTPS for the upstream remote:</strong><br />
    (Replace with the HTTPS URL of the original project if different)<br />
<code>`git remote add upstream https://github.com/ibrahim-sisar/EduLite.git`</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using SSH for the upstream remote (if you prefer SSH for all remotes):</strong><br />
    (Replace with the SSH URL of the original project if different)<br />
<code>`git remote add upstream git@github.com:ibrahim-sisar/EduLite.git`</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Verify Your Remotes (Optional but Recommended):</strong><br />
    You can check that both <code>origin</code> (your fork) and <code>upstream</code> (the original project) are set up correctly:<br />
<code>`git remote -v`</code><br />
    You should see output similar to this:<br />
<code>origin  git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/EduLite.git (fetch)</code><br />
<code>origin  git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/EduLite.git (push)</code><br />
<code>upstream        [https://github.com/ibrahim-sisar/EduLite.git](https://github.com/ibrahim-sisar/EduLite.git) (fetch)</code><br />
<code>upstream        [https://github.com/ibrahim-sisar/EduLite.git](https://github.com/ibrahim-sisar/EduLite.git) (push)</code><br />

<h1>Working with Branches: Keeping Your Code Organized</h1>
<p>In Git, branches are like parallel universes for your project. They allow you to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation without affecting the main, stable version of your code (often called <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>). This is a cornerstone of clean, collaborative, and safe development.</p>

        <h3 id="why-are-branches-so-important">Why Are Branches So Important?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isolation of Work:</strong> Keep new, potentially unstable code separate from your stable <code>main</code> branch until it's ready.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel Development:</strong> Allow multiple developers (or even just you working on multiple tasks) to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without tripping over each other.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Experimentation:</strong> Try out new ideas or approaches on a branch. If it doesn't work out, you can simply discard the branch without impacting the main project.</li>
<li><strong>Clearer History:</strong> When branches are merged, they can provide a clear history of how features were developed and integrated.</li>

    </span>
    <span class="sb-alert-content">
        <p><strong>Almost always, avoid working directly on your <code>main</code> (or <code>master</code>) branch!</strong> For any new piece of work‚Äîa feature, a bug fix, documentation, an experiment‚Äîalways create a new branch first. This keeps your <code>main</code> branch clean, stable, and potentially shippable at all times.</p>
    </span>
</div>

<h3>Creating a New Branch (and Switching to It)</h3>
<p>The most common way to create a new branch and immediately start working on it is with the <code>git checkout -b</code> command:</p>
<p><code>`git checkout -b &lt;your-new-branch-name&gt;`</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This command does two things:<ol>
<li>Creates a new branch named <code>&lt;your-new-branch-name&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Switches your working directory to this new branch.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Choosing Good Branch Names:</strong><br />
Descriptive branch names are crucial for understanding the purpose of the work being done.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be Clear and Concise:</strong> Examples:<ul>
<li>For a new feature: <code>`git checkout -b feature/user-login-page`</code></li>
<li>For fixing a bug: <code>`git checkout -b fix/submit-button-alignment`</code></li>
<li>For documentation updates: <code>`git checkout -b docs/update-installation-guide`</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Common Conventions:</strong> Many teams use prefixes like <code>feature/</code>, <code>fix/</code>, <code>docs/</code>, <code>chore/</code>, etc. Using hyphens (<code>-</code>) to separate words is also a common practice.</li>
</ul>
<div class="sb-alert sb-alert-info sb-p-3 sb-border-radius-lg sb-mb-3 sb-shadow-sm ">
    <span class="sb-alert-icon">

            ‚ÑπÔ∏è

    </span>
    <span class="sb-alert-content">
        <p>When contributing to a project (like <strong>EduLite</strong>), check if they have specific branch naming conventions outlined in their <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file or other documentation. Following project conventions is good practice!</p>
    </span>
</div>

<h3>Checking Your Current Branch &amp; Listing Branches</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To see which branch you are currently on and list all your local branches:<br />
<code>`git branch`</code><br />
    (Your current branch will be marked with an asterisk <code>*</code> and often highlighted in your terminal.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To see all branches, including local branches and remote-tracking branches (branches on GitHub that your local Git knows about):<br />
<code>`git branch -a`</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Switching Between Existing Branches</h3>
<p>If you need to switch back to a branch you've already created (without creating a new one):<br />
<code>`git checkout &lt;existing-branch-name&gt;`</code><br />
For example, to switch back to your main branch:<br />
<code>`git checkout main`</code></p>
<hr />
<h1>Making Changes to Your Code</h1>
<p>Alright, you've created and switched to your new branch! Now comes the fun part: actually making the changes for your feature, bug fix, or documentation update.</p>

    <span class="sb-alert-content">
        <p>Just a quick reminder: all the edits, new files, and deletions you're about to do should happen while you are checked out on the specific branch you created for this task (e.g., <code>feature/user-login-page</code>). This is key to keeping your work isolated and the <code>main</code> branch clean. If you're unsure, run <code>`git branch`</code> to check!</p>

        <p>Here‚Äôs the typical process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Edit Existing Files or Create New Ones:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open your project in your preferred code editor (like VS Code).</li>
<li>Make the necessary modifications to existing files.</li>
<li>Create any new files that your feature or fix requires.</li>
<li>This is where you write your code, update documentation, fix that typo, etc.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p><strong>Check the Status of Your Changes (<code>git status</code>):</strong><br />

<p><strong>Review Your Specific Changes (<code>git diff</code>):</strong><br />
    To see the exact line-by-line modifications you've made to your tracked files (those that are <em>not yet staged</em> for commit), use <code>git diff</code>:<br />
<code>`git diff`</code></p>
<ul>
<li>This command shows the differences between what's in your working directory and what's in your last commit (or what's in the staging area if you've staged some files already).</li>
<li>Lines starting with <code>-</code> (often in red) are lines removed or the old version of changed lines.</li>
<li>Lines starting with <code>+</code> (often in green) are lines added or the new version of changed lines.</li>
<li>To see changes only for a specific file:<br />
<code>`git diff path/to/your/file.py`</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Review Staged Changes (What Will Be in Your Next Commit):</strong><br />
    After you "stage" your changes (which we'll cover in the very next section!), you can see a diff of exactly what will go into your next commit using:<br />
<code>`git diff --staged`</code><br />
    (An older, equivalent command is <code>`git diff --cached`</code>.)<br />
    This is like a final review of your "package" of changes before you formally save it with a commit message.</p>

<h1>Staging Changes: Selecting What to Commit</h1>
<p>After you've made and reviewed your modifications on your feature branch, the next step in Git's workflow is "staging" those changes. Git uses a two-step process to save your work:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stage:</strong> You select the specific changes (files, or even parts of files) you want to include in your next snapshot.</li>
<li><strong>Commit:</strong> You permanently record those staged changes along with a descriptive message.</li>
</ol>
<p>This "staging area" (also known as the "index") is powerful because it lets you craft your commits precisely.</p>

    </span>
    <span class="sb-alert-content">
        <p>Think of the staging area as a "drafting table" or "shopping basket" for your next commit. You might have made many different edits in several files (your working directory). The staging area allows you to pick and choose only the changes that logically belong together for a single, focused commit. This helps keep your project history clean and understandable.</p>

<h3 id="common-ways-to-use-git-add">Common Ways to Use <code>git add</code>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stage All Changes in a Specific File:</strong><br />
    If you want to include all modifications in one particular file:<br />
<code>`git add path/to/your/filename.js`</code><br />
    (Replace <code>path/to/your/filename.js</code> with the actual file path.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stage All Changes in a Specific Directory:</strong><br />
    To add all modified and new (untracked) files within a particular directory and its subdirectories:<br />
<code>`git add path/to/your/directory/`</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stage All Changes in the Current Directory (and subdirectories):</strong><br />
    This is a very common and powerful command. The <code>.</code> symbol refers to your current working directory.<br />
<code>`git add .`</code><br />
    This command stages all modified files and all new untracked files from the current directory downwards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="verifying-what-youve-staged">Verifying What You've Staged:</h3>
<p>It's essential to check what you've staged before you commit.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Using <code>git status</code>:</strong><br />
    Run <code>`git status`</code> again after using <code>git add</code>. You'll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files listed under <strong>"Changes to be committed"</strong>: These are now in the staging area.</li>
<li>Any other modified files (that you didn't <code>add</code>) will remain under "Changes not staged for commit."</li>
<li>Untracked files that were not added will still be listed as untracked.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using <code>git diff --staged</code> (Review Actual Content):</strong><br />
    To see the exact line-by-line changes that are currently in your staging area (i.e., what will be included in your next commit), use:<br />
<code>`git diff --staged`</code><br />
    (You might also see its older synonym, <code>`git diff --cached`</code>.)<br />
    Reviewing this output is a great final check before you write your commit message.</p>

        <p>While <code>`git add .`</code> is incredibly convenient, it stages <em>everything</em> in the current directory and below. Always run <code>`git status`</code> <strong>before</strong> <code>`git add .`</code> to be sure you know what changes will be included. This helps prevent accidentally staging temporary files, build artifacts, or unrelated changes that should go into a separate commit. For more precise control, consider staging files individually or using <code>git add -p</code> for interactive staging (an advanced but very useful technique).</p>

<h1>Creating Commits: Saving Your Progress</h1>
<p>Once you've "staged" the changes you want to group together (using <code>git add</code>), the next crucial step is to <strong>commit</strong> them. A commit is like taking a permanent, named snapshot of your staged changes at that specific point in time. It becomes a recorded part of your project's history, allowing you to revisit this version, understand what changed, and collaborate effectively.</p>

        <p>The command to create a commit is <code>git commit</code>. It takes the files currently in your staging area and records them as a new version in your local repository.</p>
<h3 id="ways-to-commit">Ways to Commit:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>For a Short, Single-Line Message (Most Common for Simple Changes):</strong><br />
    Use the <code>-m</code> flag followed by your commit message in quotes:<br />
<code>`git commit -m "Add validation for user login form"`</code><br />
    This command creates the commit immediately with the message you provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For Longer, Multi-Line Messages (Recommended for More Significant Changes):</strong><br />
    If your changes require more explanation than a single line, simply run:<br />
<code>`git commit`</code><br />
    This will open your system's default text editor (or the one Git is configured to use, like VS Code, Vim, Nano). In the editor:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a concise <strong>subject line</strong> (ideally 50 characters or less).</li>
<li>Leave a <strong>blank line</strong> after the subject.</li>
<li>Write a more detailed <strong>body</strong> explaining the "what" and "why" of your changes, if necessary. You can use multiple paragraphs.<br />
Once you save and close the editor, Git will create the commit with your full message.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="writing-effective-commit-messages">Writing Effective Commit Messages:</h3>
<p>A well-written commit message is crucial. It helps others (and your future self!) understand the purpose of the change without having to read all the code.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Start with an Imperative Verb (Command Tense):</strong><br />
    Treat the subject line as if you're giving an order to the codebase.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Examples:</em> <code>`Add user profile page`</code>, <code>`Fix typo in README`</code>, <code>`Update API documentation`</code>, <code>`Refactor login logic`</code>, <code>`Remove deprecated feature`</code>.</li>
<li><em>Avoid:</em> "Added...", "Fixing...", "Updates..."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep the Subject Line Concise:</strong><br />
    Aim for around 50 characters (max ~72) for the subject. This ensures it displays well in various Git tools (like <code>git log --oneline</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Explain "What" and "Why," Not "How":</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your code shows <em>how</em> the change was made.</li>
<li>Your commit message should explain <em>what</em> the change does and <em>why</em> it was necessary or beneficial.</li>
<li><em>Example:</em> Instead of "Changed loop variable name," a better message might be "Refactor: Clarify variable name in user processing loop for readability."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use the Body for Details:</strong><br />
    If the "what" and "why" need more than a short subject line, use the body of the commit message (when you run <code>git commit</code> without <code>-m</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintain Consistency:</strong><br />
    If you're contributing to an existing project (like <strong>EduLite</strong>), look at its commit history (<code>git log</code>) to see the style and conventions used, and try to follow them.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Pushing Changes: Sharing Your Work with GitHub</h1>
<p>Once you've diligently made and committed your changes locally on your feature branch, the next crucial step is to "push" those commits to your remote repository on GitHub. Pushing essentially uploads your local branch and its commit history to your fork on GitHub. This makes your work accessible online, backs it up, and is a necessary prerequisite before you can create a Pull Request to propose your changes to the original project.</p>
<div class="sb-alert sb-alert-info sb-p-3 sb-border-radius-lg sb-mb-3 sb-shadow-sm ">

    </span>
    <span class="sb-alert-content">
        <p>When you push your branch to your fork, you're not changing the original project directly. Instead, you're updating your personal copy on GitHub. From there, you can initiate a Pull Request to suggest that the original project incorporate your contributions.</p>

        </div>

    <div class="sb-card-body sb-p-3">
        <p>The command to send your local committed changes to a remote repository is <code>git push</code>. In most common workflows for contributing, you'll be pushing to <code>origin</code>, which is the conventional name for the remote that points to your fork on GitHub.</p>
<h3 id="pushing-a-new-branch-for-the-first-time">Pushing a New Branch for the First Time</h3>
<p>If you've created a new branch locally (e.g., <code>feature/amazing-new-thing</code>) and made commits on it, the very first time you push this branch to your <code>origin</code> (your fork), you need to tell Git to establish a link between your local branch and the new branch on the remote.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Command:</strong><br />
<code>`git push -u origin your-branch-name`</code><br />
    (Make sure to replace <code>your-branch-name</code> with the actual name of your local branch, like <code>feature/amazing-new-thing</code>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Breaking Down the Command:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>git push</code>: The core command to send changes.</li>
<li><code>-u</code> (or its longer, more descriptive form <code>--set-upstream</code>): This flag is very important for the first push of a branch. It does two key things:<ol>
<li>It pushes your local <code>your-branch-name</code> to the <code>origin</code> remote, creating a branch with the same name there if it doesn't already exist.</li>
<li>It sets up a "tracking relationship." This means your local branch will now "track" (or be linked to) the remote branch <code>origin/your-branch-name</code>. This simplifies future pushes and pulls from this branch.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><code>origin</code>: The name of your remote repository (which, by default, is your fork on GitHub).</li>
<li><code>your-branch-name</code>: The name of your local branch that you want to push.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this command successfully completes, your branch and all its commits will be on your GitHub fork.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pushing-subsequent-commits-to-an-existing-remote-branch">Pushing Subsequent Commits to an Existing Remote Branch</h3>
<p>Once your local branch is tracking a remote branch (because you used the <code>-u</code> flag on its first push), sending any new local commits you make on that branch is much simpler:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Command:</strong><br />
<code>`git push`</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why This Works:</strong><br />
    Since the tracking relationship was established, Git knows that when you're on <code>your-branch-name</code> locally and type <code>git push</code>, you intend to send the commits to <code>origin/your-branch-name</code>. No need to specify the remote or branch name again!</p>

</ul>

<h1>Creating a Pull Request: Proposing Your Changes</h1>
<p>You've done the local work: created a branch, made your changes, committed them, and pushed your branch to your fork on GitHub. Fantastic! The next essential step is to create a <strong>Pull Request</strong> (often shortened to <strong>PR</strong>).</p>

        </div>

    <div class="sb-card-body sb-p-3">
        <p>Before you begin, quickly double-check that you have:<br />
1.  Committed all your desired changes to your local feature branch.<br />
2.  Pushed that feature branch from your local machine to your remote fork on GitHub.</p>
<p>Now, let's create the PR using the GitHub website:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Navigate to the Original Project Repository:</strong><br />
    Go to the main page of the repository you forked <em>from</em> (e.g., for our example, this would be <code>ibrahim-sisar/EduLite</code> on GitHub).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Start a New Pull Request:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A (Often Automatic):</strong> If you've recently pushed a new branch to your fork, GitHub is usually smart enough to detect this. You'll often see a yellow banner or a prominent button on the original repository's page saying something like <strong><code>Compare &amp; pull request</code></strong> next to your branch name. If you see this for your feature branch, click it! This is the quickest way.</li>
<li><strong>Option B (Manual):</strong> If you don't see the automatic prompt, click on the <strong><code>Pull requests</code></strong> tab (usually located near the top of the repository page, alongside "Code", "Issues", etc.). On the Pull Requests page, click the green <strong><code>New pull request</code></strong> button.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Configure the Base and Head Branches (This is Crucial!):</strong><br />
    You'll be taken to a "Comparing changes" page. This is where you tell GitHub <em>what</em> you want to merge and <em>where</em> you want to merge it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base Repository &amp; Base Branch:</strong><ul>
<li>Ensure the <strong>"base repository"</strong> is the original project (e.g., <code>ibrahim-sisar/EduLite</code>).</li>
<li>The <strong>"base"</strong> branch (dropdown) should be the branch in the original project that you want your changes to be merged <em>into</em>. This is typically <code>main</code>, <code>master</code>, or sometimes a <code>develop</code> branch. (Check the project's <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> if unsure).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Head Repository &amp; Compare Branch:</strong><ul>
<li>You will likely need to click the link that says <strong><code>compare across forks</code></strong>. This allows you to select your fork.</li>
<li>Set the <strong>"head repository"</strong> to <strong>your fork</strong> (e.g., <code>YOUR_USERNAME/EduLite</code>).</li>
<li>Set the <strong>"compare"</strong> branch (dropdown) to <strong>your feature branch</strong> from your fork (the one containing the changes you just pushed).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these are correctly set, GitHub will show you a summary of your commits and a "diff" (the changes you've made).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Review Your Changes:</strong><br />
    Take a moment to look at the diff displayed. Does it include all the changes you intended and nothing extra? This is a good final check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create the Pull Request &amp; Write a Clear Description:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If everything looks good, click the green <strong><code>Create pull request</code></strong> button.</li>
<li>You'll now see a form where you provide a <strong>Title</strong> and a <strong>Description</strong> for your PR:<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong> Make it clear and concise, summarizing your changes (e.g., "Fix: Prevent crash on invalid user input" or "Feat: Add dark mode toggle to settings").</li>
<li><strong>Description (Body):</strong> This is very important!<ul>
<li>Clearly explain <em>what</em> changes your PR introduces.</li>
<li>Explain <em>why</em> these changes were made (e.g., what bug it fixes, what feature it adds).</li>
<li>If your PR addresses a specific GitHub Issue, link to it by typing its number (e.g., <code>Closes #42</code>, <code>Fixes #123</code>). This often automatically links the PR and the issue.</li>
<li>Include screenshots or GIFs for any UI changes.</li>
<li>If there are specific testing steps, mention them.</li>
<li>(Many projects have a Pull Request template that will guide you on what information to include.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Submit Your Pull Request:</strong><br />
    After filling out the title and description thoroughly, click the final <strong><code>Create pull request</code></strong> button at the bottom of the form.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And that's it! Your Pull Request is now open and visible on the original project's "Pull requests" tab. Maintainers will be notified, any configured automated checks (like tests) will run, and the review process will begin. Be prepared to answer questions or make further changes based on feedback!</p>

<p>Once your Pull Request (PR) is open on GitHub, it's common to need to make further changes. This might be because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintainers have reviewed your code and requested modifications.</li>
<li>The main branch of the original project (e.g., <code>main</code> or <code>develop</code>) has been updated, and you want to incorporate these latest changes into your PR branch to ensure compatibility and reduce future merge conflicts.</li>

<p>If reviewers ask for changes on your PR:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Make the Changes Locally:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First, make sure you are on your feature branch:<br />
<code>`git checkout your-feature-branch`</code><br />
  (Replace <code>your-feature-branch</code> with the actual name of your branch.)</li>
<li>Use your code editor to make the requested modifications to your files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commit Your New Changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stage the files you've changed:<br />
<code>`git add .`</code> (to stage all changes in the current directory)<br />
  or <code>`git add path/to/specific/file.py`</code> (to stage specific files).</li>
<li>Commit these changes with a clear message, often referencing the review:<br />
<code>`git commit -m "Address review feedback: Refactor user service"`</code><br />
  You can also create multiple small commits if the feedback involves several distinct points.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Push to Your Fork:</strong><br />
    Push the new commit(s) to the <strong>exact same branch</strong> on your remote fork (usually <code>origin</code>):<br />
<code>`git push`</code></p>
<p>GitHub will automatically detect these new commits and add them to your existing Pull Request. There's no need to close and re-open it!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="scenario-2-updating-your-branch-with-changes-from-the-original-projects-main-branch-rebasing">Scenario 2: Updating Your Branch with Changes from the Original Project's Main Branch (Rebasing)</h3>
<p>It's good practice to keep your feature branch up-to-date with the latest changes from the original project's main development line (e.g., <code>upstream/main</code> or <code>upstream/develop</code>). This helps prevent large merge conflicts when your PR is eventually merged. Rebasing is a common and clean way to achieve this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ensure Your Local Knowledge of <code>upstream</code> is Current:</strong><br />
    Fetch the latest changes from the <code>upstream</code> remote (the original project):<br />
<code>`git fetch upstream`</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Switch to Your Feature Branch:</strong><br />
    Make sure you are on the branch you want to update:<br />
<code>`git checkout your-feature-branch`</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rebase Your Branch onto <code>upstream/main</code>:</strong><br />
    This command takes the commits from your feature branch and re-applies them, one by one, on top of the latest commit from <code>upstream/main</code> (or whichever branch is the target, like <code>upstream/develop</code>).<br />
<code>`git rebase upstream/main`</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Rebasing <em>rewrites the commit history</em> of your local feature branch. The commit SHAs will change.</li>
<li><strong>Conflicts:</strong> If your changes conflict with changes from <code>upstream/main</code>, Git will pause the rebase and ask you to resolve the conflicts. After resolving them in your editor, you'll use <code>`git add &lt;conflicted-file&gt;`</code> and then <code>`git rebase --continue`</code>. (Detailed conflict resolution is often covered in its own section.) If you get stuck, you can abort with <code>`git rebase --abort`</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Push Your Rebased Branch to Your Fork:</strong><br />
    Because rebasing rewrites history, your local branch will have diverged from the version on your remote fork. You'll need to "force push" to update the branch on <code>origin</code>.<br />
<code>`git push --force origin your-feature-branch`</code><br />
    (Or, if your local branch is correctly tracking the remote branch and has the same name, often just <code>`git push --force`</code> or <code>`git push -f`</code> will work.)</p>

<li><strong>Rewriting History (<code>git rebase</code>):</strong> This is generally safe and encouraged for your <em>own feature branches</em> that you haven't shared extensively or that others aren't directly basing work off of (common for PR branches on your fork). It keeps the project history linear and clean.</li>
<li><strong>Force Pushing (<code>--force</code> or <code>-f</code>):</strong> This command overwrites the remote branch with your local version.<ul>
<li><strong>When is it okay?</strong> For your own Pull Request branch on your personal fork, force pushing after a rebase is a standard and often necessary practice to keep the PR updated with a clean history.</li>
<li><strong>When to AVOID?</strong> <strong>Never force push to shared branches</strong> like <code>main</code>, <code>develop</code>, or any branch that other collaborators are actively pulling from and basing their work on. This can cause serious problems for them by rewriting history they depend on.</li>
<li><strong>A Safer Alternative:</strong> Consider using <code>`git push --force-with-lease`</code>. It's a more cautious version of force push that will only proceed if the remote branch hasn't been updated by someone else since your last fetch, helping to prevent accidentally overwriting others' work on that remote branch if it were shared (though less of a concern for your own fork's PR branch).</li>

<h1>Handling Merge Conflicts: Resolving Clashing Changes</h1>
<p>Sooner or later, as you work with Git‚Äîespecially in collaborative projects or when keeping your branches updated with an active <code>main</code> branch‚Äîyou'll encounter <strong>merge conflicts</strong>.</p>
<p>A merge conflict occurs when Git is trying to combine changes from two different sources (e.g., your branch and the <code>main</code> branch, or two different commits during a rebase) and finds that both sources have made different changes to the <strong>same lines in the same file(s)</strong>. Git can't automatically decide which version is correct, so it pauses the operation and asks for your help.</p>

        <p>Seeing a "merge conflict" message for the first time can be a bit alarming, but it's a very normal part of using Git. It doesn't mean you've broken anything catastrophically! Git is simply telling you it needs your human intelligence to make the right decision about how to combine the overlapping changes.</p>

        </div>

    <div class="sb-card-body sb-p-3">
        <p>When a merge conflict happens (for example, during a <code>`git rebase`</code>, <code>`git merge`</code>, or even a <code>`git pull`</code> that involves a merge), Git will:<br />
1.  Inform you that there are conflicts.<br />
2.  Modify the conflicted files to show you exactly where the overlapping changes are, using special "conflict markers."<br />
3.  Pause the ongoing operation (e.g., the rebase or merge) until you've resolved the issues.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs how to approach resolving them:</p>
<h3 id="1-identify-the-conflicted-files">1. Identify the Conflicted Files</h3>
<ul>
<li>Git will usually list the files that have conflicts in its output.</li>
<li>Running <code>`git status`</code> is your best friend here. It will clearly show "Unmerged paths" (or similar), listing the files that need your attention.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-understand-the-conflict-markers-in-the-file">2. Understand the Conflict Markers in the File</h3>
<p>Open each conflicted file in your code editor. You will see sections clearly marked by Git, like this example:</p>

        <ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code></strong>: Marks the beginning of the conflicting lines from <strong>your</strong> current changes (what <code>HEAD</code> pointed to).</li>
<li><strong><code>=======</code></strong>: This line separates your changes from the "incoming" changes.</li>
<li><strong><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ...</code></strong>: Marks the end of the conflicting lines from the <strong>other</strong> source (the branch name or commit reference after <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> tells you where these changes came from).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-resolve-the-conflict-in-your-editor">3. Resolve the Conflict in Your Editor</h3>
<p>Your task is to edit the file to make it look exactly how you want the final, merged version to be.<br />
* <strong>Read the conflicting sections carefully.</strong><br />
* <strong>Decide what to keep:</strong><br />
    * You might want to keep only your version (the lines between <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code> and <code>=======</code>).<br />
    * You might want to keep only their version (the lines between <code>=======</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ...</code>).<br />
    * You might need to combine parts of both versions.<br />
    * You might even need to write something entirely new that incorporates both ideas.<br />
* <strong>Crucially, you must delete all the conflict marker lines</strong> (<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ...</code>, <code>=======</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ...</code>) once you've made your edits. The file should only contain the code/text you intend to keep.<br />
* <strong>Save the file</strong> after you've resolved the conflict within it.</p>
<h3 id="4-stage-the-resolved-files">4. Stage the Resolved File(s)</h3>
<p>After you've edited a conflicted file and saved your resolution, you need to tell Git that you've handled it by adding it to the staging area:<br />
<code>`git add path/to/your/resolved_file.txt`</code><br />
If you had multiple conflicted files, you'll need to resolve and <code>`git add`</code> each one.<br />
(You can also use <code>`git add .`</code> if you're sure all resolved files are ready and there are no other unintended changes to stage.)</p>
<h3 id="5-complete-the-interrupted-operation">5. Complete the Interrupted Operation</h3>
<p>The command to finalize the process depends on what operation caused the conflict:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If the conflict occurred during a <code>git merge</code>:</strong><br />
    Once all conflicts are resolved and staged, complete the merge by creating a merge commit:<br />
<code>`git commit`</code><br />
    (Git usually provides a default merge commit message, which you can edit.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the conflict occurred during a <code>git rebase</code> (common when updating your PR branch):</strong><br />
    The sequence you provided in your original snippet is for this scenario. Here's the flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>You likely started with <code>`git fetch upstream`</code> and then <code>`git rebase upstream/main`</code>.</li>
<li>Git paused due to a conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Resolve &amp; Stage:</strong> You've just done this (Steps 2, 3, and 4 above).</li>
<li><strong>Continue the Rebase:</strong> Tell Git to proceed with applying the rest of your commits:<br />
<code>`git rebase --continue`</code><br />
    If more conflicts arise on subsequent commits during the rebase, repeat the resolve-add-continue cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Aborting a Rebase (Escape Hatch):</strong> If the rebase becomes too complex or you want to start over, you can abort it:<br />
<code>`git rebase --abort`</code><br />
    This will return your branch to the state it was in before you started the rebase.</li>
<li><strong>After a Successful Rebase:</strong> Once the rebase completes without further conflicts, your local branch's history has been rewritten. You will then need to force push to update your branch on your remote fork (e.g., <code>origin</code>):<br />
<code>`git push --force origin your-feature-branch`</code><br />
    (Or, more safely, <code>`git push --force-with-lease origin your-feature-branch`</code>)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Git Command Cheat Sheet  QUICK REFERENCE</h1>
<p>As you get more familiar with Git, you'll start to remember these commands. Until then, here's a quick reference for some of the most common and useful ones you'll encounter, especially when making your first contributions. For full details on any command, you can always type <code>`git &lt;command&gt; --help`</code> in your terminal.</p>

            <h5 class="sb-card-title">üõ†Ô∏è Essential Git Commands at a Glance</h5>
        </div>

    <div class="sb-card-body sb-p-3">
        <p>Here are some common Git commands grouped by their general purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting Up Your Environment &amp; Project:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>`git clone &lt;repository_url&gt;`</code>: Downloads a copy of an existing remote repository (like a fork) to your local machine.</li>
<li><code>`git config --global user.name "Your Name"`</code>: Sets the name that will be attached to your commits globally.</li>
<li><code>`git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`</code>: Sets the email that will be attached to your commits globally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Checking Status &amp; Reviewing Changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>`git status`</code>: Shows the current state of your working directory and staging area (what's changed, what's staged, what's untracked).</li>
<li><code>`git log`</code>: Displays the commit history for the current branch. (Use <code>q</code> to quit the log view).</li>
<li><code>`git diff`</code>: Shows the line-by-line differences between your working directory files and your last commit (or staged changes).</li>
<li><code>`git diff --staged`</code> (or <code>`git diff --cached`</code>): Shows the differences between your staged changes and your last commit (i.e., what will be in the next commit).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Working with Branches:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>`git branch`</code>: Lists all your local branches. The current branch is marked with an asterisk (<code>*</code>).</li>
<li><code>`git branch &lt;new-branch-name&gt;`</code>: Creates a new local branch (but doesn't switch to it).</li>
<li><code>`git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;`</code>: Switches your working directory to an existing branch.</li>
<li><code>`git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt;`</code>: Creates a new local branch <strong>and</strong> immediately switches to it. This is very common.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Staging &amp; Committing Changes (The Core Workflow):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>`git add &lt;file-or-directory-path&gt;`</code>: Adds changes from the specified file(s) or directory to the staging area.</li>
<li><code>`git add .`</code>: Stages all new and modified files in the current directory and its subdirectories. (Use with <code>`git status`</code> first to be sure!)</li>
<li><code>`git commit -m "Your concise commit message"`</code>: Records the staged changes to your local repository with a short message.</li>
<li><code>`git commit`</code>: Opens your text editor to write a more detailed (multi-line) commit message.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Synchronizing with Remote Repositories (like GitHub):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>`git remote -v`</code>: Lists all your configured remote repositories (like <code>origin</code> and <code>upstream</code>).</li>
<li><code>`git fetch &lt;remote_name&gt;`</code> (e.g., <code>`git fetch upstream`</code>): Downloads changes, branches, and tags from the specified remote repository but <strong>does not</strong> merge them into your local working branch.</li>
<li><code>`git pull &lt;remote_name&gt; &lt;branch_name&gt;`</code> (e.g., <code>`git pull origin main`</code>): Fetches changes from the specified remote branch and immediately tries to <strong>merge</strong> them into your current local branch. (Equivalent to <code>git fetch</code> followed by <code>git merge</code>).</li>
<li><code>`git push -u &lt;remote_name&gt; &lt;branch_name&gt;`</code> (e.g., <code>`git push -u origin feature/my-work`</code>): Pushes your local branch to the remote repository for the first time and sets up upstream tracking.</li>
<li><code>`git push`</code>: Pushes your committed changes from your current local branch to its linked remote branch (if tracking is set up).</li>
<li><code>`git rebase &lt;base_branch&gt;`</code> (e.g., <code>`git rebase upstream/main`</code>): Re-applies commits from your current branch onto the tip of another branch, creating a linear history. <strong>Use with caution, especially on shared branches, as it rewrites history.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temporarily Saving Changes &amp; Undoing (Use with Care):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>`git stash`</code>: Temporarily shelves uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged) in your working directory, allowing you to switch branches or work on something else. Use <code>`git stash pop`</code> or <code>`git stash apply`</code> to reapply.</li>
<li><code>`git reset &lt;file&gt;`</code>: Unstages a file (removes it from the staging area) but keeps the changes in your working directory.</li>
<li><code>`git revert &lt;commit-hash&gt;`</code>: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a previous commit. This is a safe way to undo changes in a shared history because it doesn't alter existing history.</li>
<li><code>`git reset --hard &lt;commit-hash-or-HEAD&gt;`</code>: <strong>(Potentially Destructive!)</strong> Resets your current branch HEAD, staging area, and working directory to a specific commit, discarding all changes made since that commit in the working directory and staging area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow these steps to make your first open source contribution. This exercise simulates the complete workflow, from forking a project to submitting a Pull Request.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Fork the Repository:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/ibrahim-sisar/EduLite">EduLite GitHub repository</a>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong><code>Fork</code></strong> button in the top-right corner to create your own copy of the project under your GitHub account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clone Your Fork Locally:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On your GitHub page for <em>your fork</em> of <code>EduLite</code>, click the <strong><code>&lt;&gt; Code</code></strong> button and copy the clone URL (HTTPS or SSH, depending on your setup).</li>
<li>In your terminal, navigate to where you want to store the project and run:<br />
<code>`git clone &lt;your-forked-repository-url&gt;`</code></li>
<li>Change into the newly created project directory:<br />
<code>`cd EduLite`</code></li>
<li><strong>(Important!) Add an <code>upstream</code> remote</strong> pointing to the original EduLite repository:<br />
<code>`git remote add upstream https://github.com/ibrahim-sisar/EduLite.git`</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a New Branch:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always create a new branch for your changes. Give it a descriptive name, for example:<br />
<code>`git checkout -b my-first-improvement`</code><br />
    (e.g., <code>`git checkout -b fix/readme-typo`</code> or <code>`git checkout -b docs/add-setup-clarification`</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make a Small Improvement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find something simple to change.</strong> This could be:<ul>
<li>Fixing a typo in the <code>README.md</code> file or other documentation files (files ending in <code>.md</code>).</li>
<li>Adding a clarifying sentence to the documentation.</li>
<li>Correcting a broken link if you spot one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use your code editor to make the change. For this first exercise, focus on a small, straightforward text edit.</li>
<li><em>(Tip: Look for files ending in <code>.md</code> for documentation to edit.)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commit and Push Your Changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stage</strong> your change(s):<br />
<code>`git add .`</code> (or <code>`git add &lt;path/to/your/changed_file.md&gt;`</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Commit</strong> your change(s) with a clear, concise message:<br />
<code>`git commit -m "Docs: Fix typo in installation instructions"`</code> (This is just an example message!)</li>
<li><strong>Push</strong> your new branch (with your commit) to your fork on GitHub:<br />
<code>`git push -u origin my-first-improvement`</code> (Use your branch name)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create Your First Pull Request (PR):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the original <strong><a href="https://github.com/ibrahim-sisar/EduLite">EduLite GitHub repository</a></strong> on GitHub.</li>
<li>You should see a prompt to "Compare &amp; pull request" for your recently pushed branch. Click it!</li>
<li>If not, go to the "Pull requests" tab and click "New pull request".</li>
<li>Ensure the base repository is <code>ibrahim-sisar/EduLite</code> (merging into its <code>main</code> or <code>develop</code> branch) and the head repository is <em>your fork</em> comparing <em>your feature branch</em>.</li>
<li>Write a clear title and a brief description for your PR (e.g., "Fixed a typo in the README's setup section.").</li>
<li>Click "Create pull request".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experience the Review Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Congratulations! You've submitted a PR.</li>
<li>A maintainer might review it, leave comments, or merge it. Be responsive to any feedback.</li>
<li>This step might take some time depending on maintainer availability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Goal of this Exercise:</strong> To successfully navigate the full open source contribution workflow, from forking a project to having a Pull Request opened on the EduLite project with your small improvement.</p>

            <p>This can happen for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local branch is out of date:</strong> The remote branch has changes you don't have locally. You might need to <code>`git pull`</code> (or better, <code>`git fetch`</code> then <code>`git rebase`</code> or <code>`git merge`</code>) first. This is less common when pushing a brand new feature branch for the first time but can happen if you're re-pushing to an existing remote branch.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication failed:</strong> Double-check your PAT or SSH key setup. Refer to the "Authenticating with GitHub" section.</li>
<li><strong>Wrong remote or branch:</strong> Are you sure you're trying to push to <code>origin</code> (your fork) and not <code>upstream</code> (the original project, where you likely don't have direct push access)?</li>
<li><strong>Force push needed:</strong> If you've rebased or amended commits that were already pushed, your local history differs from the remote, and a regular push will be rejected. You'll need to force push (e.g., <code>`git push --force-with-lease origin your-branch-name`</code>).</li>

<li><strong>Create a new branch from the current state of your <code>main</code> branch.</strong> This new branch will now have your accidental commits:<br />
<code>`git checkout -b my-intended-feature-branch`</code></li>
<li><strong>Now, reset your local <code>main</code> branch back to match the <code>upstream/main</code> (the original project's main).</strong><ul>
<li>Switch back to <code>main</code>: <code>`git checkout main`</code></li>
<li>Fetch the latest from upstream: <code>`git fetch upstream`</code></li>
<li>Reset <code>main</code> hard to <code>upstream/main</code>. <strong>Warning:</strong> This will discard any commits on your local <code>main</code> that are not on <code>upstream/main</code> (which is what you want in this case for the accidental commits, but be sure!).<br />
<code>`git reset --hard upstream/main`</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Update your fork's <code>main</code> branch (if you had already pushed the mistaken commits there):</strong><br />
    If your <code>origin/main</code> (on GitHub) has those mistaken commits, you'll need to force push to correct it:<br />
<code>`git push origin main --force`</code> (Use with caution, but for your own fork's <code>main</code> to correct a mistake, it's usually okay).</li>
<li>Now, continue your work on <code>my-intended-feature-branch</code> and create your PR from there!</li>
