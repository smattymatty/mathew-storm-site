# Chapter 2: The Weight of Crowns

Zeus woke with his hands at his own throat.

The dream: always the same. Chronos's jaws opening. His siblings screaming as they disappeared into darkness. Then the shift - his own hands crushing a windpipe. His face in water: his father's face staring back.

He gasped awake, tent canvas pressing down. Poseidon snored in the corner. Zeus silent: can't show breaking. Leaders don't break.

Outside. Cold air, pre-dawn. Camp sleeping.

Distant palace on the ridge: throne visible even from here. Waiting.

His hands shaking. Looked at them in moonlight. His father's hands.

"I am not my father."

Whispered it. Didn't believe it.

Then he saw movement: Metis's tent. Lamplight burning. She was awake too, but working. Not haunted. The contrast struck him like a blow.

Poseidon appeared beside him.

"You were restless." That accusotry edge. The one he reserved for his brother.

Zeus shrugged. What could he say?

"The strategist. Metis. You trust her?"

He remembered: her walking into war council yesterday. "You're not winning this through volume." The way she'd laid her map over theirs. The certainty.

"I trust she sees things we don't." Careful words. The kind he'd practiced for leadership.

Poseidon studied his face. "You're looking at her the way father looked at power."

Zeus's spine stiffened. "I'm nothing like-"

"Not yet." Poseidon's voice flat. "None of us are. Yet."

The word hung between them.

Hades emerged from another tent. Saw them, joined without speaking. He said nothing, but his silence agreed. The quiet brother who'd learned to swallow screaming.

Three brothers who survived. Three who watched Chronos consume the others.

They stood together in silence, then disperced as the dawn broke red. Poseidon first, already turning away. Hades followed moments later, a shadow peeling away.

Zeus alone with the water cup. Hands still shaking. In the distance: Chronos's palace. Closer: Metis's tent.

---

Night had fallen. The day passed in preparation Zeus barely remembered.

He stood in the command tent, staring at Metis's map. The modifications she'd made. The empty spaces where wars were won.

Footsteps. She entered without asking permission.

"You're still awake."

"Studying your strategy."

"Our strategy." Correction automatic. Teacher's instinct. She sat across from him, spread additional maps. Charcoal-stained fingers moving with precision. "Tomorrow's battle is simple. The war after is harder."

She traced routes. Explained timing. Zeus listened, but also watched. The way she bit her lip when thinking. The certainty in how she moved. How she corrected him without hesitation.

"Here." She pointed. "Your instinct will be to pursue when they break. Don't."

"Why not?" A Genuine question. Not challenging - he wanted to understand.

"Because Chronos expects rage. Give him calculation instead." She said it like a law of nature. Like she'd proven it a hundred times before.

They worked through scenarios. Hours passing. Lamp burning low.

"Why did you really come here?" Zeus asked.

She looked up. "I told you. To teach-"

"No. Really." His eyes locked on hers. "You had safe positions. You walked into a losing war to teach angry gods mercy. Why?"

Long pause. Measuring him. Measuring the risk. "Because I can see patterns. And the pattern says you become your father unless someone shows you differently."

The truth hit Zeus like a fist. 

"What if I already am?" His voice dropped. The question he'd been choking on since he woke.

"Then I wasted a three-week journey." She didn't look away. "But I don't think you are. Not yet."

Zeus reached across the map. Didn't quite touch her hand. "And if I listen? If I learn?"

"Then maybe we stop the cycle. Maybe we build something that doesn't require your children to overthrow you."

She was thinking decades ahead. He could barely see past tomorrow.

"Teach me," he said. Meant it. The first honest thing he'd said all day.

She smiled: small, sad, hopeful. "I already am."

They returned to the maps. But something had shifted. Their shoulders nearly touching as they leaned over the table. Her explaining. Him asking questions, actually wanting answers.

Not the symbol. Not the king. Just Zeus, learning.

Hours later, she stood to leave. "Tomorrow we win. Tomorrow you become king."

His hand moved, unconsciously, toward where a throne would be. Closed around empty air.

"With you," he said. "We do this together."

She studied his face. Something flickered there. Doubt? Fear?

"Together," she agreed.

But the word sounded different in her mouth. Like she was agreeing to something he didn't quite say.

She left.

Zeus was alone with maps and the gesture his hand had just made.

Claiming. Taking. Wanting both.

---

Zeus climbed to the ridge above camp. Couldn't sleep. Both armies visible below: his camp's nervous fires, Chronos's palace lights.

The throne up there. Through distant windows.

Tomorrow decided everything.

Footsteps behind him. Didn't turn.

"Couldn't sleep either?" Metis's voice.

She sat beside him on cold stone. Comfortable silence.

Then, once again broken by Metis: "What will you do with it? When you win?"

"With what?"

"The throne. The power." She gestured at the palace. "What you're fighting for."

He realized: hadn't thought past victory. Just: defeat father, take throne, become king.

"I'll rule differently. With counsel."

"Whose counsel?"

He looked at her. "Yours. If you'll give it."

"And if I refuse?"

The question caught him off-guard. "Why would you?"

"Because power changes people. Because thrones corrupt." She watched him carefully. "Because you might become what you're fighting."

"I'm not him."

"Your father said that too. Once."

The words landed like blows. Zeus stood, pacing. "Then what? I defeat him and walk away? Let someone else rule?"

"I'm not saying that."

"Then what are you saying?"

"I'm saying..." She stood too, facing him. "Be careful what you reach for. Make sure you know why you want it."

Zeus looked at her, really looked.

Saw: the teacher trying to save him.
Saw: the woman he was falling for.
Saw: the wisdom he needed.

But also felt: the hunger. The certainty that throne should be his. The need to claim.

"I want to be different," he said. Meant it.

"I want to build what we talked about." Also true.

"I want-" He stopped.

Couldn't say: I want you.
Couldn't say: I want the throne.
Couldn't admit: I want both, and I'll have both.

She touched his arm. "Tomorrow we win. Then we see who you become."

Started walking back to camp.

Zeus watched her go. Then turned to the palace. The throne visible through windows.

His hand moved again: that unconscious gesture. Reached toward it across the distance. Closed into a fist.

He could have both. The love that made him better. The power that made him king.

With her wisdom, he'd be different.

Wouldn't he?

Thunder rumbled distant. Zeus didn't notice. Too busy imagining tomorrow. Victory. Throne. Her beside it.

His. All of it his.
