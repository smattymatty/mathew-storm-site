# Chapter 1: The Garden (Post-Metis Revision)

Ixion had spent three years perfecting the art of being almost good enough.

Three years as king. Three years of successful campaigns, profitable alliances, 
strategic marriages. Three years of building Thessaly into something that mattered.

Three years of being the best mortal ruler in Greece.

Second-best, if you counted the gods.

Which everyone did.

The invitation to Olympus arrived on a morning when he was reviewing tax policy. 
Gold-leaf edges. Zeus's personal seal. An invitation to the autumn feast.

His hands didn't shake. He was past that.

Dia found him in his study, staring at the scroll.

"You're going," she said. Not a question.

"Would be an insult to refuse."

"It would be safer to refuse."

"I didn't become king by being safe." He set down the invitation, met her eyes. 
"This is the opportunity. The one we've been building toward."

Dia – his wife, his actual wife, whom he'd married for love and politics in equal measure – 
crossed her arms. "The opportunity to what, exactly?"

"To prove we're equals."

"We're not equals. They're immortal."

"They're immortal. We're innovative." Ixion gestured at the papers covering his desk: 
agricultural reforms, new trade routes, legal codes that actually worked. 
"Look what we've built. In three years. Without divine power. 
Just intelligence and effort and—"

"Hubris?"

"Vision."

Dia sighed. "You're going to do something stupid."

"I'm going to do something ambitious." He stood, started sorting through his formal clothes. 
"Zeus invited mortals to Olympus because he values mortal ingenuity. 
Everyone knows the story – Metis, the Titaness who taught him strategy, 
showed him mercy could be tactical."

"The Titaness he swallowed."

"After she helped him win the war." Ixion found his best chiton, 
the one that made him look almost godlike. "The point is: Zeus respects intelligence. 
Wisdom. Innovation. All the things we represent."

"Or," Dia said carefully, "he invites mortals to Olympus to remind them they're mortal. 
To show them their place."

"Then I'll show him otherwise."

She watched him dress with the expression of someone watching 
a loved one walk toward a cliff. "What's the plan, exactly?"

"Impress them. Network. Make it clear that Thessaly – that *we* – 
aren't just another mortal kingdom waiting for divine intervention. 
We're partners. Potential equals."

"Ixion—"

"Zeus learned from a mortal mind." He adjusted his chiton in the bronze mirror. 
"He swallowed Metis to keep her wisdom. That's how valuable mortal intelligence was to him. 
So valuable he couldn't risk losing it."

"That's not the lesson I'd take from that story."

"The lesson is that gods need us." Ixion turned to face her. 
"They need our creativity. Our mortality gives us urgency, makes us sharper. 
We die, so we innovate. They live forever, so they stagnate."

Dia was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Promise me you won't try to seduce anyone."

"I'm not going there for sex, I'm going there for status."

"Promise me anyway."

"I promise I won't do anything you wouldn't do."

"That's not reassuring. I'd absolutely seduce a goddess for political advantage."

He laughed. Kissed her forehead. "I'll be back in three days. Try not to revolutionize 
the entire kingdom while I'm gone."

"No promises."

---

Olympus was exactly as magnificent and insufferable as he'd expected.

Gods everywhere, beautiful and powerful and completely aware of both facts. 
Mortals scattered among them like decorations: nervous kings, 
ambitious heroes, that one philosopher who wouldn't shut up about forms.

Ixion took a cup of wine from a server and immediately started networking.

"Hermes, right? God of commerce? I've been working on some trade route innovations—"

Hermes smiled politely and drifted away.

"Apollo – I heard you're interested in poetry. I've been patronizing the arts in Thessaly—"

Apollo's expression suggested he found mortal poetry quaint.

"Athena, perfect. I've been developing new tactical frameworks for—"

Athena looked at him like he was a child showing her a mud pie.

By the third hour, Ixion's jaw hurt from smiling. The gods were polite, 
distantly amused, treating him like an interesting pet rather than an equal.

None of them took him seriously.

He found himself in the gardens, away from the crowd, trying not to break something.

Three years. Three years of building Thessaly into something that mattered. 
Making it prosperous, innovative, *important*. And these immortal assholes 
acted like he was a talented monkey.

"Frustrated?"

He turned. Hera stood in the lamplight, looking like every fantasy of power 
and beauty compressed into one devastating package.

"Your Majesty." He bowed. Correct depth. Correct duration.

"You've been working very hard tonight," Hera observed, 
moving closer. "Trying to impress everyone."

"Trying to establish connections."

"Trying to prove you belong here." She smiled. "It's not working."

The blunt honesty was almost refreshing.

"Why not?" Ixion asked.

"Because you're mortal." She said it simply, like explaining arithmetic to a child. 
"That's the hierarchy. We're gods. You're not. No amount of innovation changes that."

"Zeus learned from Metis—"

"Zeus learned from Metis and then swallowed her." 
Hera's voice was sharp. "That's what happens when mortals get too close to divine power. 
They get consumed."

She stepped closer, and Ixion suddenly understood this wasn't casual conversation.

"You want to be taken seriously?" Hera asked. "You want to be seen as an equal? 
There's exactly one way to do that."

"What?"

"Marry into the family." Her hand found his chest. 
"Zeus has his political marriage. I could have mine."

Ixion's brain stuttered. "You're... propositioning me?"

"I'm offering you a shortcut." Her fingers traced patterns against his chiton. 
"Marrying a goddess would elevate you. Make you semi-divine. 
Give you the status you're so desperately chasing."

"You're married. To Zeus."

"Zeus has a cupbearer. I'm allowed compensations."

This was insane. This was a trap. This was—

This was exactly what he'd wanted. Not her specifically, but what she represented: 
acceptance. Elevation. Proof that mortals could rise.

"And Zeus would be fine with this?"

"Zeus would understand the politics." Hera moved closer, backing him toward a column. 
"Divine marriages are about alliances, not romance. You know that. 
You married for advantage yourself."

She wasn't wrong. And the offer was tempting in ways that had nothing to do with attraction. 
Marrying Hera would make every god take him seriously. Would cement Thessaly's importance. 
Would prove—

Would prove he could buy his way into divinity through sex and politics.

"No," Ixion said.

Hera blinked. "What?"

"No. I don't want it that way." He stepped back, putting distance between them. 
"I didn't come here to marry into status. I came here to earn recognition."

"Those are the same thing."

"They're not." Ixion was surprised by the certainty in his own voice. 
"Marrying you would make me your consort. Your attachment. 
I'd still be mortal, just... decorated with divine connection."

"Most mortals would consider that an improvement."

"Most mortals haven't spent three years building something that matters 
through actual work." He moved toward the garden exit. 
"Thank you for the offer. But I'll earn my equality the hard way."

Hera's expression shifted through several emotions: surprise, calculation, something 
almost like respect.

"You're going to leave Olympus having impressed no one," she said.

"Then I'll come back next year with more innovations and try again."

"Or—" Her voice stopped him. "Or I could tell Zeus you tried to seduce me. 
That you rejected me first only because you wanted to aim higher. 
That you thought mortal cleverness could let you claim the Queen of Olympus."

Ice ran down Ixion's spine.

"That would be a lie."

"Would it?" Hera smiled, and it was terrifying. "You came here wanting recognition. 
Wanting to prove mortals could be equals. Isn't seducing me exactly the kind of 
ambitious, innovative approach you'd take?"

"I turned you down—"

"After I caught you making advances." Her voice was silk over steel. 
"After I had to rebuff you. That's the story I'll tell."

"Why?"

"Because you need to learn the real lesson of Metis." Hera moved closer, 
her voice dropping. "She was brilliant. Strategic. Taught Zeus everything about mercy and wisdom. 
And he swallowed her the moment she became inconvenient."

She gestured around the garden, at the party beyond. 
"This system doesn't want clever mortals who demand equality. 
It wants clever mortals who know their place. You tried to climb too high, Ixion. 
Now you'll learn what happens when mortals forget they're mortal."

Lightning split the sky.

Zeus appeared with his entire court behind him.

"How DARE you," Zeus said, voice shaking the trees, "try to seduce MY WIFE."

And Ixion understood.

This was always going to happen.

From the moment he'd accepted the invitation. From the moment he'd dared to think 
he could be an equal. The system needed to punish that ambition. 
Needed to make an example.

Metis had taught Zeus about mercy and strategy.

Then Zeus had swallowed that wisdom and gone right back to ruling through power.

The lesson had never taken root.

"I didn't—" Ixion started.

"Are you calling my wife a liar?"

He could tell the truth: that Hera propositioned him, that he refused. 
But who would believe a mortal over a goddess?

He could confess to the lie: accept a crime he didn't commit to make this easier. 
But that would make Hera right, that he should have known his place.

Or he could do something else entirely.

"Yes," Ixion said. "I tried to seduce Hera. Because I believed we could be equals. 
Because I thought merit mattered more than birth. Because I was stupid enough 
to think the gods who learned from Metis might actually value mortal wisdom."

The court went silent.

Zeus's expression shifted from rage to something colder.

"You dare—"

"I dare," Ixion interrupted, "because someone has to. Metis tried to teach you. 
You swallowed her lessons along with her. And now you're right back to this: 
power and punishment and proving mortals should bow."

Athena stepped forward, voice like ice: "Mortals who don't know their place—"

"Their place." Ixion laughed, slightly unhinged. "You want to know what I learned tonight? 
Metis was wrong. Mercy isn't strategy. Wisdom doesn't matter. 
The system eats anyone who tries to change it."

Zeus's hands crackled with lightning.

"You will learn humility."

"I'll learn that you haven't learned anything at all."

Guards dragged him away.

The last thing Ixion saw: Hera's face, satisfied.

The last thing he thought: I was never going to win. The game was rigged from the start.

Then the forge.

Then the wheel.

Then forever.
