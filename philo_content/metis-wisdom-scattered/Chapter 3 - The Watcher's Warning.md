# Chapter 3: The Watcher's Warning

Prometheus had learned to watch from the edges of things.

The morning war council gathered around Metis's map. Zeus at the head, Poseidon and Hades flanking, Hera mediating. The usual chaos of desperate gods trying to win an unwinnable war.

Except.

Metis stood beside Zeus, showing supply routes. Their hands didn't touch, but moved in parallel. Synchronized. When Zeus leaned forward to study a junction, Metis shifted her weight to give him better angle. When she asked a question, he answered without the defensiveness he showed everyone else.

"Here," Zeus said, tracing a path. "If we position-"

"They'll be exposed," Metis finished. "Unless we stagger the timing."

Hera caught Prometheus's eye. Raised an eyebrow. Seeing it too.

But Zeus didn't see what his hand was doing: resting on the arm of his chair. Not gripping. Just... claiming. The unconscious gesture of ownership.

Metis explained refugee routes. Zeus nodded, absorbed. His fingers drummed against the armrest. Tap tap tap. Possessive rhythm.

"Tomorrow we flood the valley," Metis said. "Show them terror isn't the only way."

"Together," Zeus agreed.

The word hung there. Two meanings in one sound.

Metis heard: partnership.
Zeus meant: king and valued advisor.

Prometheus saw the gap between.

After the meeting broke, Zeus stayed behind. Studying Metis's map like it held secrets. His hand moved again—that gesture. Reaching toward something that wasn't there yet.

Prometheus remembered Chronos at that age. Same hunger. Same certainty he'd be different.

"She's remarkable, isn't she?"

Zeus jerked, hadn't heard him approach. "Effective."

"More than that." Prometheus moved to stand beside him. "Different from anyone here."

Zeus studied the map. "She sees patterns. Consequences. Things we miss."

"And after? When Chronos falls?"

"We build something better. Together."

There—that pause before 'together.' Microsecond hesitation.

"Will you share the throne?"

Zeus laughed. "There shouldn't BE a throne. We'll have a council. No more tyrants."

"Your father said that too. Once."

Zeus's expression flickered. Anger, fear, denial. "I'm not my father."

"Not yet," Prometheus said quietly.

The words hit. Zeus's hand tightened on the chair. "You think I'll become him?"

"I think thrones change people. Power reveals what was hidden."

"Then I'll prove you wrong." Zeus met his eyes. "With her counsel, I'll be different."

Prometheus looked at the chair where Zeus's hand rested. The claiming gesture Zeus didn't know he was making.

"I hope so," he said. Didn't believe it.

Prometheus descended alone as evening fell.

The cave entrance opened like a mouth. Inside: the Fates at their loom, weaving reality itself.

They didn't look up, they knew he was coming.

"The Titan who sees ahead," Clotho said, threading, "comes to see further ahead."

"I need to know. About Zeus and Metis."

Lachesis looked up from her weaving. "Need to KNOW? Or need to HEAR?"

"There's a difference," Atropos added, scissors gleaming. "Knowing changes nothing. Hearing makes you complicit."

Prometheus hesitated. Then: "Tell me."

Clotho held up two threads: gold and silver, intertwining. Beautiful pattern forming as Lachesis wove them together.

"When?" Prometheus asked.

"When power fears love more than it loves power."

"Can I stop it?"

"You can watch." Lachesis's fingers never stopped moving. "That's your gift. And your curse."

"There must be something-"

Atropos raised her scissors. Held them above the pattern.

"Wait-"

She cut.

The golden thread remained. The silver scattered into fragments: not destroyed, but distributed. Infinite pieces spreading across the loom.

"The king survives," Atropos said. "Wisdom... transforms."

They showed him more:

A throne room. Zeus alone. Dead flowers everywhere.

Silver light scattered across the world. Everywhere and nowhere.

An eagle. A rock. Chains. Liver growing back forever.

Prometheus understood the last one. "Because I'll try to help her."

"Because you'll try to help THEM," the Fates said together. "Both of them. Love makes fools of the wise."

"Then I won't help. I'll warn them. Tell them what's coming."

The Fates looked at him with infinite pity.

"And Zeus will thank you for the warning?" Clotho asked. "Will trust you more?"

"And Metis will abandon her mission?" Lachesis continued. "Stop planting seeds?"

"Or will they both resent you," Atropos finished, "for suggesting their love is doomed?"

Prometheus saw it: telling Zeus would make the prophecy come true faster. Telling Metis would break her hope. Telling both would change nothing except making him the enemy.

"Now you understand." The Fates returned to their weaving. "You can watch. You can witness. You can remember. But you cannot prevent."

"So I do nothing?"

"You do what love requires: bear witness to tragedy. Hold space for their choices. And when the scattering comes-" Atropos touched the silver fragments on the loom. "-you remember what wisdom looked like whole."

Prometheus climbed back toward the surface. The weight of knowledge pressed down with each step.

He knew. Couldn't un-know. Couldn't act on knowing.

The perfect trap.

---

Prometheus found Metis in the grove, studying stars.

She looked up, smiled. "Couldn't sleep either?"

"Thinking about tomorrow."

"We'll win." She patted the ground beside her. "Come. Help me with these calculations."

He sat. Watched her work. The certainty in her movements. The hope.

"You really believe he'll listen," Prometheus said. "That he'll choose wisdom over power."

"I have to." She traced constellation patterns. "Otherwise what's the point?"

"What if power consumes wisdom instead?"

She laughed. Dismissed it. "Zeus isn't like that. He listens. He values counsel."

"Everyone's different," Prometheus said, "until they're not."

She touched his arm. "I know you worry. But trust me. Trust him. We're going to build something beautiful."

He looked at her: so certain, so hopeful. Wanted to tell her about the Fates. About scissors and scattered silver and thrones that poison.

But she wouldn't believe him. Would think he was jealous, or afraid, or trying to undermine her work.

"I do trust you," he lied. "Both of you."

After she returned to her tent, Prometheus remained under stars.

Could tell her: she wouldn't listen.
Could tell Zeus: he'd hate him for it.
Could tell both: would make it worse.

The Fates showed him chains. That was the price of helping.

But what was the price of staying silent?

He thought of the vision: silver light scattered. Infinite fragments. Not destroyed, but transformed. Wisdom scattered becoming wisdom everywhere.

Maybe... maybe the tragedy served something larger. Maybe her consumption created something her preservation couldn't.

He hated himself for thinking it. For already learning to justify cruelty as necessity.

Maybe that's what happened when you saw the future: you became complicit in it.

Prometheus made his choice.

He would watch. Bear witness. Remember.

When Zeus reached for the throne, Prometheus would see it.
When Metis offered mercy, he would see it.
When the consumption came, he would see it.

And after, when wisdom scattered, he would remember what she'd tried to build.

Someone had to.

Love made you blind to what you feared most to see.
Foresight made you see what you were powerless to prevent.

He had both. The perfect curse.
