# Chapter 3: The Pattern

The wheel had been spinning for—

Ixion couldn't finish the thought. The version of himself he just had to witness, it was particularly exhausting. 

Just spin. Burn. Remember. Forget.

The memories were coming faster now. Fragments flying past like shrapnel. Each one feeling real while it lasted. Each one dissolving into doubt the moment it ended.

Garden. Bedroom. Party. Murder.

Love. Conquest. Hubris. Crime.

Which was real? Any of them? All of them?

The wheel didn't answer. Just spun.

Another rotation. The fire flared hotter—or maybe it was the same temperature it had always been and his nerves were just learning new ways to interpret agony.

A memory surfaced.

This one felt different. Heavier. More like drowning than remembering.

The wheel locked into it.

Time stopped blurring.

Ixion gasped as the memory pulled him under.

---

"You can't go."

Dia stood in the doorway of their chambers, face pale. Not the careful queen-mask she wore in court. Just Dia. Afraid.

"It's an invitation from Zeus," Ixion said, reading the scroll for the third time. "I can't refuse."

"You can. You send regrets. Affairs of state. Illness. Anything."

"That would be an insult."

"Going would be suicide." She moved closer, grabbed his arm. "Ixion, please. Listen to me. Everyone who goes to those parties comes back broken. Or they don't come back at all."

"That's superstition."

"It's pattern recognition." Her grip tightened. "Three kings in the last five years. All invited to Olympus. All returned changed. Or dead. Or bound to Zeus's service forever."

Ixion pulled his arm free gently. "I'm not those kings."

"You think you're special?" Not cruel. Desperate. "You think Zeus singles you out for honor? He singles you out for a reason, and it's never because he likes you."

"Then what? I refuse and wait for him to destroy me for the insult?" Ixion set down the scroll. "At least if I go, I have a chance."

"A chance at what?"

He didn't have an answer for that.

A knock at the door. His chief advisor entered without waiting for permission—which meant bad news.

"My lord, the council requests your immediate presence."

"Now?"

"They're... insistent."

Dia's expression said: See?

The council chamber was full. All twelve advisors present. None of them meeting his eyes.

His war captain spoke first. "You received the invitation."

"Yes."

"And you're considering refusing."

"I'm considering my options."

"There are no options." The treasurer this time. "You must attend."

"Must?"

"My lord, please understand." His oldest advisor, the one who'd served his father. "Zeus's invitations are not optional. Refusing would mean—"

"I know what it would mean."

"Then you know you have to go." The war captain's hand rested on his sword hilt. "For Thessaly. For all of us."

Ixion looked at them. Really looked. Saw the fear. Saw the calculation. Saw men who'd decided their king's life was worth less than avoiding Zeus's wrath.

"And if I don't return?"

"Then we'll honor your sacrifice," the treasurer said smoothly. "And ensure Thessaly continues to prosper."

They'd already planned for it. Already decided. He was expendable.

"I see." Ixion stood. "Then I suppose I'm going to Olympus."

The relief in the room was palpable.

"Wise choice, my lord."

"For Thessaly."

"You'll make us proud."

Ixion left before he could say what he thought of their pride.

Back in his chambers, Dia was packing a bag.

"What are you doing?"

"Coming with you."

"No."

"Ixion—"

"If this is a trap, one of us needs to survive." He took the bag from her hands. "Stay. Rule. If I don't come back—"

"Don't say that."

"If I don't come back, remember me correctly." He met her eyes. "Not as the hero they'll make me. Not as the fool they'll call me. Just... as who I actually was."

She kissed his forehead. "Come back and I won't have to remember anything."

But they both knew he wouldn't.

The council had already decided.

---

The memory shifted. Rewound. Or fast-forwarded. Time didn't work right in these fragments.

Different scene. Older memory. Before the invitation. Before everything.

Deioneus stood in his throne room, demanding the bride-price. Loud. Aggressive. Too aggressive.

"You agreed to the terms," Deioneus said. "Twelve horses. Twenty ingots of gold. You've paid nothing."

"I agreed to discuss terms," Ixion corrected. "We never finalized—"

"You married my daughter!"

"At your suggestion."

"And now you refuse to honor the agreement?" Deioneus moved closer. Other men with him. Armed. "That's not how these things work, Ixion."

"Is that a threat?"

"It's a statement of fact." Deioneus smiled. "You pay. Or you face consequences."

Ixion's guards shifted, hands moving to weapons. Deioneus's men matched them. The throne room went tense.

"Everyone out," Ixion said quietly. "Now."

The guards hesitated. 

"OUT."

They filed out. Slowly. Reluctantly. Leaving Ixion alone with Deioneus and his armed men.

"Smart," Deioneus said. "No witnesses for what comes next."

"What comes next is you leaving my kingdom."

"What comes next is you paying what you owe. Or—" Deioneus gestured to his men. "We take it."

They moved fast. Too fast. Trained.

Ixion fought back but he was one man against five. They beat him methodically. Professionally. Breaking ribs. Splitting lips. Leaving marks that would fade but hurt enough to remember.

When they finished, Deioneus crouched beside him.

"You have three days. Pay. Or next time we take Dia instead." He stood. "Oh, and Ixion? Zeus sends his regards."

"What?"

But they were already leaving.

Ixion lay on the floor of his own throne room, bleeding, trying to process what Deioneus had just said.

Zeus sends his regards.

Three days later, Deioneus returned. Alone this time. Arrogant. Certain.

They met in the courtyard. No guards. No witnesses.

"Well?" Deioneus demanded. "Where's my payment?"

"Here." Ixion gestured to a pit in the courtyard—decorative feature, usually filled with water and flowers. Today: empty, showing the fire pit beneath.

Deioneus moved to look.

Someone pushed him.

Not Ixion. Someone behind him. Someone who moved fast and disappeared faster.

Deioneus fell. Screamed. The fire caught quickly.

Ixion stood frozen, watching, not understanding what had just happened.

His guards appeared from nowhere. Surrounded him.

"My lord, what have you done?"

"I didn't—"

"You killed him!"

"No, someone else—"

But there was no one else. Just Ixion standing over the pit. Just Deioneus burning. Just guards witnessing their king commit murder.

"This was self-defense," his war captain said firmly. "He attacked. You defended. We all saw it."

"You weren't here—"

"We saw it," the captain repeated. More weight this time. "Everyone saw it. Deioneus attacked. You had no choice."

The other guards nodded. All of them. Agreeing to the lie.

Creating the story.

Making Ixion a murderer.

Later, much later, Ixion found the note. Slipped under his door. No signature.

"One crime makes you malleable. Keep you scared. Keep you grateful when Zeus shows mercy. Welcome to the game. -A Friend"

He burned it.

But he couldn't unlearn what it meant.

---

The memory shifted again. Forward. To Olympus. To the party.

But this version was different.

Ixion arrived nervous. Watched. Knowing somehow this was a trap but not knowing how.

He saw Hera by the fountain. Tried to avoid her. Moved toward the gardens instead.

She followed.

"Ixion of Thessaly." Her voice made him stop. "Running already?"

"Your Majesty. I was just—"

"Just avoiding me?" She moved closer. "That's not very flattering."

"I meant no disrespect."

"Then walk with me." Not a request. An order.

They moved through the gardens. Ixion's neck prickling. This felt wrong. Choreographed.

"You know why Zeus invited you?" Hera asked.

"To honor my kingship?"

"To test you. To see if you're loyal. Ambitious. Dangerous." She stopped, turned to face him. "To see what you'll do when offered something you shouldn't want."

"I don't understand."

"You will." She stepped closer. "Zeus has made a copy of me. Cloud-body. It will approach you soon. Offer itself. You can refuse—prove yourself loyal, leave here alive but diminished. Or you can accept—prove yourself ambitious, and he'll find uses for that."

"Or I can do neither," Ixion said. "Leave now."

"And insult Zeus by refusing his test?" Hera smiled. "That's the third option. Also fatal." She moved even closer. "There's no winning move, Ixion. There never was. You were chosen the moment that invitation was written. The only question is which punishment you prefer."

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because I'm tired of watching mortal men walk into Zeus's games thinking they have agency." She touched his face. "You don't. You never did. From the moment Deioneus was sent to your kingdom, you've been dancing on strings."

"Deioneus was—"

"Sent by Zeus. Yes. To create your first crime. To make you killable. To give Zeus leverage." Hera stepped back. "The cloud is coming. Choose your death, Ixion. But know that you're choosing."

She dissolved into mist.

Ixion stood alone.

Then she appeared again—but different. More solid. Less certain.

"There you are," the cloud-Hera said. "I've been looking for you."

And Ixion understood.

There was no good choice. No right answer. No escape.

He could refuse: die for insulting Zeus.
He could accept: die for defiling Zeus's wife.
He could flee: die for cowardice.

The game was rigged.

It had always been rigged.

He chose to play anyway. Because at least that way he'd die doing something instead of nothing.

What followed was mechanical. Cloud-Hera willing. Ixion complying. Both of them performing roles written by someone else.

When Zeus appeared with his court, Ixion wasn't surprised.

When the accusations came, he didn't defend himself.

When they dragged him to the forge, he didn't fight.

What was the point?

He'd lost before he'd arrived. Before the invitation. Before Deioneus. Before he'd been born.

The gods needed a mortal to destroy. They'd chosen him. Everything else was just theater.

The wheel was built. The chains were fastened. The fire was lit.

And as Ixion began to spin, he realized the cruelest part:

He'd never know which version was real.

Had he loved? Had he conquered? Had he been played?

All of them? None of them?

The wheel didn't care.

It just spun.

---

Back in the present. The memory released him.

Ixion gasped. Fire burning. Chains cutting. Wheel turning.

Three memories now. Three versions. Three different men.

The lover who was punished for existing wrong.

The conqueror who was punished for hubris.

The pawn who was punished for being chosen.

Which was real?

The wheel spun faster.

More memories surfacing. Contradicting. Overlapping. Fragmenting.

Dia as friend. Dia as property. Dia as co-conspirator. Dia as victim.

Ganymede as love. Ganymede as temptation. Ganymede as fiction. Ganymede as agent.

Deioneus as victim. Deioneus as attacker. Deioneus as pawn. Deioneus as invented.

Zeus as punisher. Zeus as manipulator. Zeus as projector. Zeus as systematizer.

All of them true. All of them lies.

The fire burned.

The wheel turned.

And Ixion, spinning in the dark, began to understand something terrible:

The punishment wasn't the pain.

The punishment was the uncertainty.

Being forced to experience every possible version of his life—victim, villain, lover, pawn—and never knowing which had actually happened.

Being scattered across infinite realities, all equally vivid, all equally false.

Unable to reconstruct the truth from the fragments.

That was the real torture.

Not the fire.

The forgetting.

The wheel spun on.

The memories continued to leak.

And somewhere in the darkness, Ixion tried to hold onto something—any truth, any certainty, any piece of himself that made sense.

But the wheel kept fragmenting him.

Kept showing him different pasts.

Kept making him question everything.

Until eventually—he couldn't remember anymore.

Couldn't remember which crime was real.

Couldn't remember who he'd been.

Couldn't remember if any of it had happened at all.

The wheel turned.

The fire burned.

And the truth—

The truth dissolved into infinite versions of itself.

All of them real.

All of them lies.

Forever.
