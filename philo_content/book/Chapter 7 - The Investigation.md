# Chapter 7 - The Investigation

Theron pushed open the workshop door without knocking.

The scene inside stopped him for a half-second. Not the architects working - that was expected. But the guards. Nikias and Alexios sat at the workbench with Daedalus and Sisyphus, the four of them hunched over a blueprint in conversation that died the instant the door opened.

Nikias shot to his feet. Alexios's hand moved toward his spear before he caught himself.

"Lieutenant," Nikias said, too quickly. "We were just-"

"Supervising?" Theron stepped fully inside, two more guards filing in behind him. His eyes swept the workshop, cataloging everything: the scattered tools, the fresh ink on blueprints, the wine cups on the table. "Or socializing?"

"The architects were explaining the structural-" Alexios began.

"The architects." Theron picked up one of the wine cups, sniffed it, set it down. "Have been explaining things for months now, haven't they? And you've been listening so carefully." He looked at Nikias. "Your son is in the guard corps, isn't he? And your daughter?"

Nikias's face went carefully blank. "Yes, sir."

"Good family. Loyal service." Theron turned to Daedalus. "I need you to guide me through the labyrinth. Specifically Sector Three. There's been an... anomaly."

Daedalus's stylus clattered to the table. "An anomaly?"

"A tribute reached Sector Four." Theron watched both architects carefully. "Unprecedented progress. I need to understand how."

"Sector Four." Daedalus's voice was thin. "That's - that's very deep. The passages there are complex, the structure unstable-"

"Then you'll need to be careful guiding us." Theron's tone was pleasant. "Unless there's some reason you can't?"

Daedalus looked at Sisyphus, then away quickly. "No. No reason. It's just - the work down there is still in progress, we'd need to plan the route carefully-"

"How long?"

"To plan? Several hours, maybe a day to map a safe-"

"We go now." Theron moved to the blueprint they'd been studying. "This shows Sector Three, doesn't it?" He traced a passage with one finger. "Explain this section."

"That's a disorientation chamber," Sisyphus said, his voice calm. "Walls appear to converge but don't. Creates spatial confusion."

"Appears to converge." Theron looked up. "But they're actually parallel?"

A pause. Too long.

"No," Daedalus said quickly. "They do converge. The appearance is accurate. That's the deception - victims trust their eyes, which leads them deeper into-"

"Show me." Theron straightened. "We descend now. You'll guide us through Sector Three, show me exactly where this tribute traveled, and explain how he survived."

"Lieutenant, I must advise-" Daedalus's hands were shaking. "The labyrinth has been... evolving. There have been changes we haven't fully documented yet. Going down unprepared-"

"Evolving how?"

Daedalus glanced at Sisyphus again. Sisyphus's expression gave away nothing.

"The Minotaur," Alexios said suddenly. "We've heard it working. At night. Moving stone."

Theron's attention snapped to him. "The beast is modifying the structure?"

"We think so," Nikias added, clearly trying to help. "The sounds - they're architectural. Tool work, not hunting."

"And you didn't report this?"

Silence.

"Because you're scared." Theron's smile was cold. "Of going back down. Of not knowing which passages are safe anymore. Of discovering your perfect labyrinth has been compromised." He looked at Daedalus. "By your own creation."

"It's not fear," Daedalus said, but his voice betrayed him. "It's caution. Proper procedure would be to-"

"Now." Theron cut him off. "Both architects. Both guards. We descend together, you show me Sector Three, and we discover exactly what's been evolving down there." He paused at the door. "Unless someone wants to confess something before we go?"

No one spoke.

Sisyphus stood slowly, gathering tools with the careful movements of someone who'd done this many times before. "You'll want torches," he said. "And rope. The acoustic properties in Sector Three make it difficult to navigate by sound alone."

"How thoughtful." Theron watched him. "You seem remarkably calm about descending into a maze that terrifies your colleague."

"I've dealt with mazes before." Sisyphus met his eyes steadily. "And with men who think they understand what they're walking into."

"Is that a warning?"

"Advice." Sisyphus picked up a chisel, examined it, set it back down. "Mortal men should be careful about places designed to kill them. Even when they think they're in control."

Theron's expression didn't change, but something shifted in his posture. "Mortal men," he repeated slowly. "An interesting way to phrase it."

Sisyphus said nothing.

"Gather what you need," Theron ordered. "We leave in ten minutes." He looked at Nikias and Alexios. "And you two two, remember which side you're on. Family is easy to protect when you're loyal. Much harder when you're not."

The threat was clear. The guards nodded, faces carefully blank.

As Theron stepped out to confer with his men, Daedalus grabbed Sisyphus's arm. "We can't go down there," he whispered urgently. "The Minotaur's passages, we don't know which deceptions are ours anymore. We could get lost. We could-"

"We're going." Sisyphus pulled free gently. "He knows something. If we refuse, it confirms guilt."

"But if we go down and can't get back out-"

"Then we improvise." Sisyphus began gathering rope, torches, tools. "Like we always do."

"You don't understand," Daedalus hissed. "I built those passages to lie. And now something else is building new lies. I won't know which is which. I won't-"

"Then I'll get us out." Sisyphus's voice was quieter. "Trust me. I've escaped impossible places before."

"How?"

Sisyphus smiled slightly. "Practice."

---

The descent into the labyrinth took an hour.

Or perhaps longer. Time behaved strangely in the depths. Theron led with a torch that threw shadows that moved wrong - lagging behind movements, or anticipating them. The air grew heavier with each level, thick with stone dust and something older than memory.

Behind him came Nikias and Alexios, weapons drawn despite knowing blades were useless against geometry. Then Daedalus, each step more reluctant than the last, his breathing shallow. And finally Sisyphus, walking with the careful attention of someone who'd learned to navigate impossible spaces.

They passed through Sector One quickly. Standard deceptions—passages that appeared to fork but didn't, chambers that seemed smaller from inside than their entrances suggested. Theron cataloged each one with clinical precision. Clever work, but comprehensible.

Sector Two was where the architecture stopped pretending to be normal.

A staircase descended while somehow climbing. Theron tested each step before committing his weight, his torch revealing stone that curved while maintaining edges sharp enough to draw blood. The walls here absorbed sound in some chambers, amplified it in others.

"The acoustics are designed to disorient," Daedalus explained, his voice thin and strange in the air. "Victims can't tell if breathing they hear is their own or something else's."

As if to demonstrate, Theron's footsteps echoed from three different directions at once. He stopped. The echoes continued for two beats longer than they should have.

"Effective," Theron said. But something in his voice had changed. This wasn't just architecture anymore. This was something else.

They descended further.

Sector Three announced itself through wrongness that made Theron's chest tighten. The stone deceived in ways that made his eyes hurt. Passages that looked identical led to completely different destinations. Walls that appeared solid shimmered at the edges of vision. The torch light seemed weaker, as if darkness here had substance, weight, hunger.

"This is where it happened," Theron said, stopping at a junction where three passages met in angles that his mind refused to calculate. "Where the tribute made his breakthrough."

Daedalus approached slowly, studying the walls with the expression of a man reading his own death warrant. His hands traced patterns in the air, calculating sight lines and stress points. Then he went very still.

"What?" Theron demanded.

"This passage." Daedalus pointed to the leftmost corridor with a trembling hand. "I designed it with converging walls. Creates disorientation, makes victims think they're entering a chamber when they're actually being compressed toward a dead end."

"Show me."

They entered. Ten paces in, Nikias stumbled. "The walls-"

"Are parallel," Theron finished. He ran his palm along the stone, feeling its impossible truth. In the Queen's chambers, she'd spoken of a beast that learned. Of passages that changed. Of a system that ate everyone who touched it.

He'd thought she was mad.

"They should converge," Daedalus said, pressing both hands against the wall as if testing whether reality was still real. "They *did* converge. I built them to-" His voice cracked. "Someone changed them."

"Recently." Theron's torch revealed fresh chisel marks in the stone. "The dust is still loose. Days old at most."

A sound cut through the air. Deep. Resonant. The sound of stone being worked, but wrong - too rhythmic, too purposeful, too intelligent. Coming from below them. From Sector Four.

Everyone froze.

"The Minotaur," Daedalus whispered.

The sound continued. Steady. Patient. Something massive moving through passages it was actively reshaping. The rhythm wasn't hunting. It was construction.

Theron's hand moved to his sword. The gesture was instinctive, useless. What did you fight geometry with? What blade cut sound?

"It's building," Alexios said quietly. "We tried to tell-"

"Silence." Theron's voice was sharp, but something in it had fractured. The Queen had tried to tell him too.

The working sounds stopped abruptly.

The silence was so much worse.

"We should go back," Daedalus said, backing toward the entrance. "Before it realizes we're here. Before-"

A scraping sound. Closer than before. Then breathing. Slow. Heavy. Deliberate. Something large in the darkness just beyond the torchlight, patiently waiting.

"Lieutenant," Nikias said quietly. "We need to leave. Now."

But Theron couldn't move. His mind was trying to process what his eyes were seeing: fresh tool marks on the walls that weren't there before. Crude compared to Daedalus's precision, but learning. The beast wasn't just contained here. It was studying. Adapting. Building.

The Queen had been right.

"Here." Theron forced himself to move, pointing his torch at another section. His hand was shaking. "These indentations. Handholds."

He pulled the chisel from his belt - the one he'd taken from the workshop - and held it against one of the marks. The wear pattern matched exactly.

"Your tool, Sisyphus." His voice was steady through force of will alone. "Someone has been systematically modifying these passages. Giving tributes a path."

From the darkness ahead, a sound. Not breathing now. Something else. A low rumble that might have been curiosity, trying to understand why these architects had returned.

"But not escape," Theron continued, building his case even as his mind screamed at him to run. "Never escape. Just... deeper death."

"Lieutenant, we need to go," Daedalus said again. "It's studying us. Learning. The longer we stay-"

"Show me the body." Theron's jaw was set. "I need to see where these modifications led."

"That's in Sector Four," Daedalus said. "Where it is. Where it's been working. We can't-"

"Show. Me."

The descent to Sector Four nearly broke them.

The passages here were new. Walls that hadn't existed three days ago now formed corridors that led in directions that shouldn't exist. Fresh tool marks scored the stone - crude but purposeful, improving with each mark. The beast was teaching itself architecture.

And it was getting better.

They found Theseus in a feeding chamber.

Theron had seen death before. Battlefield casualties. Execution victims. Bodies broken by torture or time. But this was different. The boy lay in the center of the chamber like an offering. His hands were shredded from climbing, from using those carefully placed handholds. Blood smears on the walls traced his path, showed exactly how he'd navigated Sector Three using modifications that shouldn't exist.

"Theseus of Athens," a guard said, checking the manifest with a voice that shook. "Son of Aegeus."

Theron knelt beside the body. The boy's fists were still clenched, holding the shape of something no longer there. His face held an expression Theron had seen before, the look of someone who'd died with hope.

In his experience, hope was always crueler than despair.

"He made it farther than anyone in recorded history," Theron said, his voice hollow. "Because someone gave him a path." He stood, turning to face Sisyphus. "And it led him here."

Around them, the chamber walls told a story. The Minotaur had been here, studying Theseus's path. Fresh crude marks mimicked the handholds Sisyphus had carved. The beast was learning from mercy, teaching itself how compassion could be weaponized.

A sound from deeper in the chamber. Heavy breathing. Rhythmic. Patient.

It was still here.

"We're leaving," Theron said. "Now. Bring the body."

"Lieutenant-" Daedalus started.

"NOW."

They didn't run, that would be undisciplined. But moved with urgent purpose through passages that seemed to shift behind them, following Daedalus's frantic navigation through deceptions that might no longer be reliable. The sound of breathing followed them. Never close enough to see. Never far enough to forget.

When they emerged into afternoon sunlight, Theron stood gasping, his carefully maintained composure shattered. Behind him, guards carried Theseus's wrapped body. Nikias and Alexios looked shaken. Daedalus was openly weeping.

Only Sisyphus seemed unchanged.

"Confined to quarters," Theron managed. "Both architects. The King..." He stopped. What did you tell the king about this? That his perfect system had learned to think? That the Queen had been right about everything?

"The King will hear of this," he finished. "Tomorrow you face judgment."

As guards led them away, Theron stood in the courtyard, still holding the chisel. Evidence of sabotage. Evidence of mercy. Evidence of something far worse than either; defiance.

The Queen had tried to warn him. About thrones being poisoned. About systems that consumed everyone who served them. About truth that ate you alive.

He'd demanded proof.

Now he had it.

---

Minos received Theron's report in the throne room at sunset.

No court. No ministers. Just the two of them—king and investigator, with Theseus's wrapped body laid on the stone floor between them.

"Modifications," Theron said, spreading drawings across the floor. "Sector Three. Tool marks match Sisyphus's chisel exactly. The tribute used them - you can see the path in the blood. Handholds where there should be smooth walls. Parallel passages where they should converge. Acoustic zones reversed." He pointed to the body. "This is where it led him."

Minos circled the corpse slowly. His fingers drummed against his thigh - three quick, two slow, three quick, two slow. He knelt, pulled back the cloth, studied Theseus's shredded hands.

"He climbed," Minos said softly. "Believed someone was helping him."

"Yes, Your Majesty."

"And died anyway."

"Yes."

Minos stood abruptly. "Bring them. Both architects. Now."

---

Ten minutes later, Sisyphus and Daedalus stood before the throne, flanked by guards. Theseus's body lay between them and the King. Daedalus stared at it, face white. Sisyphus's expression gave nothing away.

Minos didn't sit. Didn't speak. Just drummed his fingers and stared at Sisyphus for a long, terrible moment.

Then he moved.

Fast. Violent. Grabbed one of Theron's drawings and shoved it at Sisyphus's face.

"THIS. You did this?" His voice cracked. "You modified MY labyrinth? MY perfect system?"

"Yes."

"WHY?" The word echoed. Minos's composure shattered like glass. "You looked at what I built and thought - what? That it needed KINDNESS?" He laughed, high and wrong. "That mercy had a place in a machine designed to KILL?"

"They deserved a chance-"

"DESERVED?" Minos threw the drawing. It fluttered to the floor. "That boy DESERVED to die in Sector One! Quick! Clean! Honest!" He pointed at Theseus. "Instead you gave him hope. Made him climb. Made him BELIEVE. And he died anyway - slower, deeper, with more time to understand that survival was NEVER POSSIBLE."

His fingers drummed frantically. Three quick, two slow, faster, faster.

"Your Majesty," Daedalus whispered, "if I could explain-"

"YOU?" Minos spun on him. "You KNEW. Don't lie. Stone dust. Worker reports. You suspected and did NOTHING." He stepped closer. "Your son. Icarus. Brilliant with his hands, I'm told. Would be such a shame if-"

"Please-"

"-if his father's incompetence cost him his position at court."

Daedalus's face crumpled.

Minos turned back to Sisyphus. The rage drained from his voice, replaced by something colder.

"Sisyphus of Corinth." Minos circled slowly. "My father sent you. Said you'd be useful. An architect who understood systems." His fingers drummed. Three quick, two slow. "And the first thing you do is HELP them? Hide mercy in MY walls?"

He stopped directly in front of Sisyphus.

"Do you know what you've done?"

Sisyphus said nothing.

Minos turned away sharply.

"Theron. Recommendation?"

"Execution, Your Majesty."

"Execution." Minos laughed. 

"No." Minos's smile was terrible. "No, execution is too simple. Too honest." His fingers drummed. "You want to give tributes a chance? Fine. You'll test the labyrinth. Tomorrow. Dawn. You'll walk your own path, every modification you made. Prove they work. Survive them."

"Your Majesty-" Daedalus started.

"And then Sector Four." Minos ignored him. "Where the beast is. Where it's been learning. Where it's waiting." His voice rose again. "You'll face what you TAUGHT. You'll die where that boy died. And we'll ALL watch you understand that your compassion was just elaborate CRUELTY-"

He stopped. Forced breath. Forced his hands still.

"Take them. Separate cells. No communication."

Guards moved forward.

"Wait-" Daedalus lunged. "Your Majesty, please, he won't survive-"

Theron's hand on his shoulder stopped him cold. "Let him go, architect. You'll have other assistants."

"But-"

"He's already gone."

They dragged Sisyphus toward the door. He looked back once, at Daedalus, not at the King. No regret in his eyes. Just acknowledgment.

They'd both known this would happen eventually.

As the door slammed shut, Minos spoke again, voice echoing in the empty throne room:

"Tomorrow at dawn. Full court. They'll watch him descend." He resumed his drumming. "They'll watch him die."

Daedalus stood frozen, staring at where Sisyphus had been.

"He won't survive Sector Four," he whispered. "Nothing survives Sector Four."

Minos sat back on his throne, smile terrible in the dying light.

"I know." His fingers drummed. Three quick, two slow. "That's the point."
