The throne room of King Minos stretched before them like the maw of some colossal beast, its painted columns rising to support a ceiling that disappeared into shadow. Daedalus felt his stomach clench with the familiar acid of self-loathing as their escort's boots echoed against polished stone. Each step measured the distance between his workshop sanctuary and this altar of judgment where his crimes were transformed into currency.

Beside him, Sisyphus walked with unnerving steadiness, as if approaching thrones was merely another form of repetitive labor. The man's calm made Daedalus's own terror more acute. In his arms, the leather portfolio grew heavier with each step—three hours of desperate creativity that would either satisfy the monster who ruled Crete or provide fresh entertainment through their deaths.

_Icarus would be fourteen now._ The thought struck without warning, as it always did in moments of stress. _Old enough to appreciate architectural beauty, young enough to still believe his father creates wonders rather than horrors._

The throne itself sat on a raised dais at the chamber's far end, carved from a single block of black marble that seemed to swallow light. Upon it sat Minos, motionless as the stone itself but infinitely more dangerous. He didn't acknowledge their approach, his attention fixed on a scroll that Daedalus recognized with sinking certainty—reports from Athens, perhaps, or intelligence about tribute preparations. The silence stretched until Daedalus's hands began their telltale tremor.

"Your Majesty," Daedalus forced out, willing his voice to steadiness his hands couldn't achieve, "we bring initial modifications to the labyrinth design, accounting for the recent... developments."

Minos raised his head with the deliberate slowness that Daedalus had learned preceded either brilliance or brutality. Those dark eyes—so like the beast's eyes, Daedalus realized with a shudder—fixed first on him with familiar contempt, then shifted to Sisyphus with the calculating assessment of someone evaluating a new blade's sharpness.

"Show me," the King commanded.

Daedalus unrolled their drawings, muscle memory taking over where courage failed. The modifications they'd sketched were good work—he knew this with the part of his mind that remained objective about craft even as the rest of him screamed. Reinforced chambers where the beast had broken through. New passage configurations that accounted for its growing intelligence. Adaptive sections that could evolve with their prisoner.

"The beast has grown stronger since the last tribute," Daedalus explained, his stylus moving with the precision that had once built temples. "These modifications account for its increased size and intelligence. The walls must be thicker here, the passages more complex there. And these chambers—" He indicated the interconnected spaces he'd designed with bitter expertise. "—allow for systematic testing of the maze's effectiveness."

He watched Minos study the plans with an absorption that reminded Daedalus of his own focus when solving architectural problems. The King's fingers traced certain passages while ignoring others, and Daedalus felt a sick recognition—Minos didn't just want functional cruelty; he wanted elegant cruelty. Artful suffering. The kind Daedalus had become expert at providing.

"This section," Minos said, tapping a confluence of passages near the labyrinth's heart. "Too straightforward. A clever tribute might navigate it too quickly." He looked at Sisyphus. "What would you do to... complicate matters?"

Daedalus felt his new assistant tense beside him. _Now you understand,_ he thought bitterly. _Now you see what we truly build here._

"Redirect the natural impulse," Sisyphus said, his voice carrying disturbing certainty. "Build passages that appear to lead toward escape but actually circle back toward danger. Let their own intelligence work against them."

The smile that spread across Minos's face made Daedalus's hands tremble harder. He knew that smile. It had appeared when Daedalus first explained how hope could be weaponized, how the human spirit's refusal to surrender could be turned into the very mechanism of its destruction.

"Yes. Precisely." Minos rolled up the plans with satisfaction that felt like hooks in Daedalus's chest. "You understand the philosophy of the project. Excellence."

_Philosophy._ Daedalus tasted bile. They called it philosophy, this systematic transformation of lives into meat. He'd built temples once, structures that lifted human spirits toward divinity. Now he built machines that ground those same spirits into fodder for a monster that should never have existed.

The King rose from his throne with the fluid grace of a predator sated but not satisfied. "Work begins immediately. I want to see structural progress by week's end, and full implementation of these modifications within the month." His gaze shifted between them like a blade testing edges. "Failure to meet these deadlines will result in... personal testing of the labyrinth's effectiveness."

As guards escorted them from the throne room, Daedalus felt Sisyphus walking beside him in contemplative silence. The man was processing what they'd just agreed to build, what they'd just become. Daedalus wanted to warn him that it only got worse, that each compromise carved away another piece of whatever soul remained. But what was the point? They would both learn soon enough that some prisons were built from the inside out, bar by bar, choice by terrible choice.

The weight of the portfolio in his arms felt heavier now, filled with future horrors he would design with the same precision he'd once used for beauty. Perdix would have solved this differently, found some clever trick to satisfy Minos without enabling slaughter. But Perdix was dead, pushed from a tower by jealous hands that now served the very cruelty they'd once only envied.

_Everyone serves something,_ he'd told Sisyphus. The truth was simpler and worse: Daedalus served his own cowardice, disguised as paternal love. Every modification, every improvement, every elegant solution—all to keep himself alive long enough to see Icarus again. Even if that meant Icarus would eventually learn his father was not a creator of wonders but an architect of nightmares.

The palace corridors seemed to multiply as they walked, each turn revealing another passage decorated with frescoes of bulls and dolphins. Daedalus kept his gaze forward, though he could feel Sisyphus observing everything with that unsettling patience of his. The guards ahead of them moved with practiced efficiency—one young, one old, the eternal pairing of enthusiasm and experience.

"The King seemed... pleased," Daedalus ventured quietly.

"Did he?" Sisyphus replied. "I thought he seemed hungry."

The younger guard glanced back with obvious curiosity. His companion, scarred and weathered, caught the look and scowled.

"Eyes front, Alexios. What you hear in these halls stays in these halls."

"But Lieutenant Theron said we should—"

"Lieutenant Theron isn't here. I am. Keep your mouth shut and your ears closed."

Daedalus noted the name—Theron. Another layer of palace politics to navigate. The boy Alexios fell silent, though his curiosity remained visible in the tension of his shoulders.

They emerged into sunlight where horses waited. Daedalus recognized the breed immediately—the native Messara horses, compact and intelligent. He approached a familiar chestnut gelding, running his hand along its neck while Sisyphus selected a mare with a white blaze.

"Mountain stock," the older guard explained to Sisyphus. "These horses know every path on the island."

"They have Arabian blood too," Daedalus heard himself adding. "The crossbreeding created an interesting gait—"

"Aravani," young Alexios interrupted eagerly. "The Turks named it. Like a traveling song, because of the rhythm."

Daedalus felt his jaw tighten. Of course the boy would know that. Everyone on Crete knew about their horses. But Daedalus had studied the breeding programs, understood the genetics, the careful selection that—

"We ride for the quarries," Sergeant Nikias announced, mounting with easy grace. "His Majesty expects you there before sunset."

They set out along paths that wound up into the mountains. The horses fell into that distinctive four-beat rhythm, smooth as water over stone. Below them, the palace shrank to toy-like proportions. Daedalus found himself gripping the reins tighter than necessary, his body fighting the unfamiliar motion despite years of making this journey.

"Tell me about these quarries," Sisyphus said, pulling alongside him.

Daedalus considered his words carefully. "The Damastas quarry has operated for generations. But recently, the scale has... expanded."

"Since the beast?"

"Since its first feeding revealed what we were truly dealing with." He lowered his voice, though the guards maintained a discrete distance. "Each tribute cycle, it grows stronger. The labyrinth must evolve to contain it."

They passed through olive groves where workers moved with practiced efficiency. Many bore scars—missing fingers, old burns. Quarry work was dangerous, especially when the stone itself defied natural law.

"How long at this scale?" Sisyphus asked as they passed a wagon loaded with impossibly large stone blocks.

"Three years." Daedalus watched the former king study the physics-defying ease with which the oxen pulled their loads. "You notice it too. The stone's... cooperation."

"Mass that shifts with intention," Sisyphus observed quietly.

Daedalus felt both pleased and irritated that Sisyphus grasped it so quickly. "The labyrinth requires materials that exist in flexible relationships with physical law. The stone learns its purpose."

The horses grew nervous as they climbed higher, ears flattening, the smooth gait becoming irregular. Even these sure-footed animals sensed the wrongness ahead.

"They know," Sergeant Nikias said with something like respect. "Island horses have instincts going back generations."

When they crested the final ridge, Daedalus watched Sisyphus take in the sight below—an excavation so vast it seemed to wound the mountain itself. He remembered his own first view of it, the vertigo of seeing stone cut at angles that shouldn't exist, platforms that seemed to float, workers moving in patterns that hurt to track with human eyes.

"Welcome," Daedalus said quietly, "to where we make the impossible possible. And then wish we hadn't."

---

The construction site sprawled below them like an open wound in the earth, revealing layer upon layer of ancient stone and newer excavation. Daedalus watched Sisyphus absorb the scale of it—workers moving in practiced patterns, the rhythmic percussion of chisel against stone, shadows falling at angles that contradicted the sun's position.

"Surface architecture is merely decoration," Daedalus explained, leading the way down a path worn smooth by countless trips. "The real labyrinth exists below."

He noted how Sisyphus studied everything with that methodical patience, processing details like a scholar memorizing text. The former king understood stone, that much was clear. Whether he'd understand what they did to stone here remained to be seen.

"How deep?" Sisyphus asked, watching workers lower a massive block into darkness.

"Seven levels confirmed, possibly more." Daedalus kept his voice neutral, though the uncertainty gnawed at him. Some mornings the measurements disagreed with previous surveys, as if the structure shifted when unobserved. But admitting that would mean acknowledging the project had evolved beyond his original design—something he wasn't ready to voice.

They approached his stone masons, men who'd learned to work with geometry that shouldn't exist. Daedalus watched Sisyphus stop short at their current project—a cornerstone that curved while maintaining sharp edges, a mathematical impossibility rendered in limestone.

"This piece," Sisyphus said, pointing, "how does it connect to conventional masonry?"

Before Daedalus could properly explain the complex mathematics involved, Keras—one of his most experienced masons—looked up with that working man's need to share expertise.

"It don't connect to regular building, sir. Master Daedalus gives us drawings, but the measurements change depending on how you look at 'em."

Daedalus felt irritation rise. These craftsmen always reduced his calculations to primitive observations. "The specifications follow precise non-Euclidean principles," he interjected. "The geometry serves specific functional requirements—"

But Sisyphus was already kneeling, hands exploring the stone with disturbing comprehension. Watching those scarred fingers trace impossible edges, Daedalus recognized someone grasping intuitively what had taken him months of calculation to achieve.

"The stone actually exists in impossible configurations," Sisyphus said.

"Aye," Keras agreed, stealing Daedalus's moment to explain. "Near drove me mad at first. But the stone knows what it wants to be."

Such crude understanding of sophisticated mathematics. Yet Daedalus had to admit their simple interpretation produced results. These unlettered craftsmen successfully cut stone that violated physical law, while scholars who read his treatises declared it impossible.

"The creature below isn't bound by conventional physics," Daedalus said, reclaiming the conversation. "Its prison must transcend similar limitations."

He watched Sisyphus straighten slowly, saw judgment settle into those patient eyes. The former king recognized this wasn't divine intervention but human ambition deliberately breaking natural law for darker purposes.

"Show me how it's done," Sisyphus said.

Daedalus gestured to Keras with mixed feelings—pride at having someone finally worth teaching, dread at how quickly this student might surpass his teacher.

---

The sun had climbed to its zenith by the time Daedalus called a halt. He watched Sisyphus set down his tools with those deliberate movements that suggested the man could have continued indefinitely. The former king's hands were raw, bleeding in places where the impossible stone had fought back, yet he showed no sign of fatigue. Only that patient assessment, as if he were cataloguing each new skill for future use.

_He learns too quickly,_ Daedalus thought, watching Sisyphus successfully position a keystone that defied three separate laws of physics. What had taken Daedalus weeks of calculation, Sisyphus grasped through mere repetition. The man approached impossible masonry like his eternal boulder—with the confidence that persistence would eventually reveal all secrets.

"Enough surface work," Daedalus announced, partly to reassert control, partly because the real test awaited below. "Time you saw where your efforts lead."

The entrance to the depths was concealed behind what appeared to be solid stone—until Daedalus pressed his palm against a specific point and the rock face split along seams that hadn't existed moments before. Beyond lay a platform suspended over darkness, connected to crude rails that descended at an angle that made Daedalus's stomach clench even after dozens of descents.

"What is this?" Sisyphus asked, studying the mechanism with obvious interest.

"My design," Daedalus said, unable to suppress the pride in his voice. "A lifting platform that operates on counterweights and..." He paused, remembering Keras's simple wisdom. "The stone knows which direction it needs to go."

They stepped onto the platform—Daedalus, Sisyphus, and two guards who looked distinctly uncomfortable with the prospect. As Daedalus manipulated the controls, the platform began its descent with a smoothness that contradicted its crude appearance.

Down they went, past layers of construction that chronicled the project's evolution. Daedalus provided commentary, partly to educate, mostly to fill the oppressive silence with something other than the growing awareness of what waited below.

"Upper levels—conventional masonry with modifications. Middle sections—architecture that challenges perception without breaking reality. But here—" They passed into deeper darkness where the lamplight seemed to struggle. "Here we build chambers that contain more than physical mass."

The platform shuddered, then resumed its descent. In the silence, they could all hear it now—a rhythmic sound like breathing, but too deep, too vast to come from any natural throat.

"Testing ground," Daedalus announced when they finally stopped, his voice carefully controlled. "Every modification must be verified before implementation in the operational sections."

The chamber that opened before them defied description. Vast enough to hold temples, yet its walls curved in patterns that made accurate measurement impossible. Passages branched off in directions that included not just the cardinal points but orientations that human language had never named. Daedalus watched Sisyphus try to process it, saw the former king's eyes water as his mind struggled with geometries that shouldn't exist.

"We build the efficiency of despair," Daedalus heard himself explaining, the words worn smooth from repetition. "Paths that promise freedom but guarantee deeper imprisonment. Chambers that offer sanctuary but become traps."

He'd given this speech to three previous assistants. Two had fled. One had thrown himself from the platform during the return ascent. But Sisyphus merely nodded, as if he'd expected nothing less.

The sound came again—closer now, a rumbling howl that vibrated through stone and bone alike. Intelligence lived in that sound, and hunger, and something worse: patience. The creature knew they were there. It was learning from their presence, from their fear, from every modification they made to its prison.

"It grows stronger," Daedalus said unnecessarily. "Each feeding teaches it something new."

"And we're teaching it too," Sisyphus observed quietly. "Every improvement we make, every refinement—we're showing it exactly how we think."

Daedalus felt his hands begin their familiar tremor. He'd had the same thought countless times but hearing it spoken aloud made it real in a way that private fears never could. They weren't just building a prison. They were educating their prisoner in the art of systematic cruelty.

"The real question," Sisyphus continued, picking up a piece of impossible stone with those scarred hands, "is whether we can teach it something other than what Minos intends."

The guards shifted nervously. Such talk bordered on the treasonous. But Daedalus found himself leaning forward despite himself. "What do you mean?"

"Every system can be subverted from within," Sisyphus said, examining the stone that shifted its weight as he turned it. "Every creation contains the seeds of its own undoing. The trick is knowing where to plant them."

Another howl rose from below, this one different—almost curious, as if the creature had heard something in their conversation worth considering. Daedalus felt ice in his veins. The beast was listening. Learning.

And now Sisyphus was suggesting they could teach it lessons Minos never intended.

Daedalus wanted to warn him about the price of such thinking, about what happened to those who tried to be clever in the king's service. But something in Sisyphus's patient confidence stopped him. This was a man who'd cheated death twice, who'd endured eternal punishment and emerged to face new torment with that maddening calm.

Perhaps, Daedalus thought with a mixture of hope and terror, perhaps he'd finally found someone who could appreciate the true horror of what they were building—and possibly, impossibly, find a way to make it serve a different purpose.

The chamber echoed with the sound of stone being shaped by immortal hands, while below, something that should never have been born listened to every strike of the chisel, learning patience from the patient, persistence from the persistent, and perhaps—though Daedalus hardly dared think it—mercy from those who had none left to lose.
