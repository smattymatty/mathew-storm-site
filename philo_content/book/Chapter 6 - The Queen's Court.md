# Chapter 6 - The Queen's Court

Queen Pasiphaë stood before her mirror as Lysippe fastened the ceremonial brooch. A golden bull. Minos's little joke, making her wear their shame like jewelry. She'd learned to bear these small cruelties without flinching.

"The King awaits in the throne room," a servant announced.

Three weeks he'd been absent from court. Three weeks of construction reports, strange vibrations through the palace stones, and quietly moving gold to discrete accounts. Now he was back, and everyone would pretend normalcy while calculating how close they stood to disaster.

The throne room was packed. Every minister, general, and merchant in their assigned positions like actors who'd memorized their marks. At the far end, Minos sat on his obsidian throne. He'd lost weight. His fingers drummed against the armrest in a pattern she didn't recognize.

She took her place beside him. He didn't acknowledge her.

"Let the session commence," Minos said.

Kleomenes shuffled forward with his financial reports, hands shaking slightly. "Your Majesty, the quarterly assessments—"

"The gods test us through our shame," Minos interrupted. His fingers kept that strange rhythm. "They give us gifts that become burdens. Blessings that become curses."

The treasurer faltered. "Yes, Your Majesty. The gods' will is... complex."

"Complex." Minos seemed to taste the word. "Like a passage that leads down while climbing. Like stone that weighs nothing until you try to move it."

Around the throne room, Pasiphaë saw the careful calculations beginning. Commander Asterion's hand had drifted to his sword hilt—not to draw it, but for comfort. Even Lieutenant Theron, who'd terrorized the council days ago, stood with unusual stillness. The ambitious thug recognized dangerous ground when he saw it.
