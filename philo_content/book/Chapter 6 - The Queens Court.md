# Chapter 6 - The Queen's Court

Queen Pasiphaë stood before her mirror as Lysippe fastened the ceremonial brooch—a golden bull, Minos's private joke. She'd learned to bear these small cruelties without flinching.

"The King awaits in the throne room," a servant announced from the doorway.

Three weeks he'd been absent from court. Three weeks of construction reports, strange vibrations through the palace stones, and quietly moving gold to discrete accounts in Athens. Now he was back, and everyone would pretend normalcy while calculating their proximity to disaster.

---

The throne room stank of incense and old fear. Every minister in their assigned positions like actors who'd memorized their marks. At the far end, Minos sat on his obsidian throne, smaller somehow despite the seat's imposing size. He'd lost weight. His robes hung like curtains on a frame. His fingers drummed against the armrest—three quick taps, pause, two slow ones, repeat.

Pasiphaë took her place on the smaller throne. The stone was cold through her robes. Minos didn't acknowledge her arrival.

"Let the session commence," he said.

Kleomenes stepped forward with the careful precision of a man who knew numbers could become nooses. The King watched him approach with an intensity that made the treasurer's steps falter.

"Your Majesty, the quarterly assessments show increased expenditure on construction materials—"

"Tell me, Kleomenes." Minos's voice was soft. Dangerous. "What is the cost of divine forgiveness?"

The treasurer blinked. "I... Your Majesty?"

"We measure everything. Grain, gold, blood. Surely the gods' mercy has a price." The fingers drummed. Three quick, two slow. "You've calculated the cost of temples. Of sacrifices. Of offerings."

Kleomenes's face had gone pale. Sweat beaded on his forehead despite the morning chill. "The gods' ways are beyond price, Your Majesty."

"Beyond price." Minos smiled without warmth. "Yet we try to buy their favor anyway." His gaze swept the crowded room, and everyone it touched flinched. "Continue."

The treasurer shuffled backward into the crowd of ministers, trying to disappear.

Three more ministers approached. Three more received philosophical tangents wrapped in accusation. Asterion's military composure cracked when questioned about loyalty. Polyidus made warding signs no one watched when his prayers were dismissed as useless. Each exchange was a variation on the same theme: Minos searching for betrayal in routine reports, finding it everywhere.

The door burst open.

A runner—young, out of breath, clearly terrified of interrupting court—stumbled forward anyway.

"Your Majesty!" he gasped. "Urgent message from the construction site!"

The court murmured. Minos's drumming fingers stopped mid-pattern.

"Speak."

The runner swallowed hard. "Your Majesty, a tribute has survived past Sector Three. The foreman reports unprecedented progress through the maze. They've—they've never seen anything like it."

The murmuring grew louder. Everyone knew about the tributes. Some had watched from a distance as Athenian youths were led into the lower passages. They didn't know the details—didn't want to know—but they understood the system. Tributes went down. Tributes didn't come back.

But Sector Three? That was deep. That was impossible.

Minos stood slowly. The court fell silent.

"How far?"

"Sector Four, Your Majesty. Still moving. The guards don't know whether to—"

"Session ended." Minos stepped down from the throne, moving toward the side exit that led to the lower passages. No explanation. No orders. No acknowledgment of the ministers standing with unfinished reports.

The court stood frozen, uncertain. Pasiphaë watched Minos disappear through the doorway, heard his footsteps echo down stone corridors. She stood, smoothing her robes.

"The King has urgent matters to attend," she announced, her voice carrying the practiced authority of someone who'd spent years covering for her husband's instability. "Resume your duties. Court will reconvene at the King's convenience."

The ministers began filing out, their relief palpable. Kleomenes moved quickly, probably heading straight to inventory what could be liquidated. Asterion conferred quietly with his officers. Polyidus stood alone, making signs of blessing that no one was watching.

Pasiphaë returned to her chambers with Lysippe following at the proper respectful distance. Only when the door closed behind them did either woman speak.

"A tribute survived past Sector Three," Lysippe said immediately, dropping the servant's deference. "That's not possible. Not unless—"

"Unless the architecture allowed it." Pasiphaë moved to her window, looking toward the distant construction site. Tiny figures moved between stone blocks. "Structure doesn't change itself. Someone changed it."

"The architects?"

"Daedalus has been terrified since the new one arrived. You've seen him—always calculating, always worried." She turned from the window. "But the other one..."

"The foreign architect?"

"Sisyphus." Pasiphaë pulled reports from her desk—construction schedules, worker accounts. "A man of his nature doesn't suddenly start following rules." She spread the papers across her desk. "Look. Stone dust in passages that should be sealed. Handholds appearing in sections designed to be smooth. Workers reporting modifications they didn't make."

"You think he's been sabotaging it?"

"I think men like that can't help themselves." She sorted the papers into piles. "I tried to warn Theron once. About the throne being poisoned, about the cost of ambition here. He turned my confession into evidence of treason." Her hand moved unconsciously to the bull brooch. "And now I'm about to make the same mistake."

"Your Majesty?"

"Speaking names aloud. Discussing escape plans. Trusting that walls don't have ears." She looked at Lysippe. "When will I learn?"

"The accounts in Athens are ready," Lysippe said quietly. "The ship can be arranged within a week. We could leave before—"

A sound from the corner made them both freeze.

A tapestry moved. Lieutenant Theron stepped into view.

Pasiphaë's blood went cold. How long had he been there? The chamber had three entrances—the main door, the servant's passage, and the old siege tunnel that had been converted to storage. She'd forgotten about the third entrance. Again. Stupid. Careless.

"Interesting conversation, Your Majesty," Theron said calmly. He held no weapons, showed no aggression. Just stood there with that same careful attention he brought to all his investigations. "The siege tunnels require regular security inspection. Can't have vulnerabilities."

A plausible excuse. Delivered with just enough respect to avoid outright insubordination. But his eyes were sharp, calculating. He'd heard something. The question was what.

"Lieutenant." Her voice was perfectly controlled despite the panic screaming through her thoughts. "The King's personal chambers are not open to military personnel."

"Forgive me, Your Majesty. I was conducting a security inspection." He gestured vaguely at the tapestry. "The old siege tunnels need to be checked regularly. We can't have vulnerabilities in the palace's defenses."

"Your diligence is noted," Pasiphaë said. "You may continue your inspection elsewhere."

"Of course, Your Majesty." He moved toward the main door, unhurried. Then paused, hand on the frame. "Though I should mention—given the tribute's unprecedented survival, it seems prudent to verify that construction proceeds according to approved specifications."

He said it casually, as if it were routine. But Pasiphaë saw the trap closing.

"Verify how?"

"A personal inspection of the tower. The architects' workshop." His tone was perfectly reasonable. "Wouldn't want any unauthorized alterations compromising the integrity of the King's project."

The foreign architect. Sisyphus. She'd said both names. He'd heard them. And now he was moving to gather physical evidence to support whatever he'd overheard.

"When?" Pasiphaë asked, though she already knew the answer would be soon.

"Immediately, Your Majesty. These matters shouldn't wait." Theron bowed with precise military courtesy. "By your leave."

He didn't wait for her to grant it. Just turned and walked out, his boots echoing down the corridor with the steady rhythm of inevitability.

Pasiphaë and Lysippe stood in silence, listening to his footsteps fade.

"How much did he hear?" Lysippe whispered finally.

"Enough." Pasiphaë moved to her desk, her hands shaking as she gathered the papers—evidence of her own plans that she'd left scattered in plain view like a fool. "He heard Sisyphus's name. Heard us discussing modifications. Probably heard about the escape timeline."

"What do we do?"

Pasiphaë looked at the papers in her hands—months of careful planning, accounts established, routes mapped. All of it potentially compromised because she'd grown careless. Because she'd thought her private chambers were safe. Because she'd done exactly what she'd done before: tried to help someone by speaking the truth aloud, only to give Theron exactly what he needed to destroy them.

"Nothing," she said quietly. "We do nothing. We wait. And we pray that Sisyphus is clever enough to hide what he's done."

But even as she said it, she knew it was false hope. Sisyphus wasn't trying to hide what he'd done. That was his nature—defiant, open, gleeful in his rebellion. He'd hidden mercy in the labyrinth's walls the way other men left signatures on their work. Proud of it.

And now Theron was going to find every single modification.

The golden bull brooch felt heavy on her chest. Below, the palace continued its daily rhythms. And somewhere in that distant tower, an architect who couldn't help himself was about to face the consequences of his compassion.

She'd tried to save Theron once by confessing the truth. He'd turned her confession into a weapon. Now she'd spoken Sisyphus's name in what she'd thought was a private conversation, and Theron would do the same thing again.

"I keep trying to save people," she said quietly. "And all I do is give Theron the tools to destroy them."

Below, she could see him, a figure in bronze armor moving with purpose across the courtyard, heading toward the tower that rose in the distance.

By tomorrow, he would have his evidence.

And there was nothing she could do to stop it.

---

Theron took the tower steps two at a time.

The tribute's survival. The Queen's speculation. The foreign architect's name. It all fit together now. Not proof yet, but a clear trail to follow.

Behind him, two guards struggled to keep pace. He didn't slow down.

Three years he'd been watching the architects. Documenting their movements, their habits, their access to sensitive areas. Daedalus was careful, paranoid even. But the new one, Sisyphus, worked with the casual confidence of someone who'd never faced real consequences.

Until now.
