<h1 id="chapter-2-the-rotation">Chapter 2: The Rotation</h1>
<p>The wheel had been spinning for three thousand years.</p>
<p>Or three days.</p>
<p>Or three seconds that stretched into eternity.</p>
<p>Time didn't work properly in Tartarus. It accumulated in pools, evaporated into nothing, ran backward through cracks in the stone. Ixion had stopped trying to count rotations around the time he'd counted to infinity twice and realized the number meant nothing.</p>
<p>The fire never stopped.</p>
<p>Divine fire—the kind that burned without consuming, that hurt without killing, that taught flesh the difference between ending and enduring. It wrapped around the wheel's rim like a lover's embrace, constant and cruel.</p>
<p>Ixion hung from the spokes, arms stretched, legs bent at angles that had stopped feeling wrong sometime after the first century. Bronze chains held him fast. Not tight enough to cut circulation—he needed to feel everything. Not loose enough to shift position—mercy wasn't part of the design.</p>
<p>The wheel spun.</p>
<p>Around him, Tartarus stretched in all directions and none. Other punishments visible in the distance: Prometheus chained to his rock, eagle returning like clockwork. Tantalus reaching for fruit that pulled away. The Danaids pouring water into broken jars, eternal and pointless.</p>
<p>At least they got to stand still.</p>
<p>The wheel completed another rotation. The world blurred past—stone walls, distant light, the edge of the pit where his wheel was mounted. Spin. Blur. Burn. Repeat.</p>
<p>His memories started leaking.</p>
<p>Not slowly. Not gently. They came in fragments, shattered pieces of a mirror reflecting different images. The wheel didn't just punish his body. It fragmented his mind. Every rotation shuffled the deck of his past, dealt him a different hand.</p>
<p>This rotation: a garden. Ganymede's face. Love.</p>
<p>Next rotation: a bedroom. Dia beneath him. Duty.</p>
<p>Next: the party. Hera's smile. Hunger.</p>
<p>Which one was real?</p>
<p>He couldn't remember anymore.</p>
<p>The fire burned hotter. The wheel spun faster. Another memory surfaced, rising like bile—</p>
<p>This one felt solid. Real. Right.</p>
<p>The wheel locked into it. Time stopped blurring.</p>
<p>Ixion gasped as the memory consumed him.</p>
<hr />
<p>He woke to morning light and Dia already awake beside him.</p>
<p>"The invitation came," she said, holding the scroll. "From Olympus."</p>
<p>Ixion grabbed it from her hand. Read Zeus's seal. Smiled.</p>
<p>"Finally." He tossed it aside, pulled her toward him. She came willingly—she always did. Three years of marriage, three years of her knowing her place. Queen of Thessaly. His conquest. His proof.</p>
<p>He took her efficiently, roughly. She responded the way a wife should—accommodating, present, doing her duty. After, he stood and dressed while she remained in bed.</p>
<p>"You'll manage things while I'm gone," he said. Not a question.</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"Three days. Maybe four if the wine's good." He adjusted his chiton in the bronze mirror. Looked good. Looked like a king. "Zeus wants to see what mortal power looks like. I'll show him."</p>
<p>"Be careful with the gods, husband."</p>
<p>"Careful?" He laughed. "I conquered six city-states. I unified Thessaly through force of will. Gods are just immortals with better wine." He moved to the door. "I'll bring you something pretty from Olympus. A trophy."</p>
<p>"I'd prefer you return intact."</p>
<p>"Where's the fun in that?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Ixion walked through his palace like he owned it. Because he did.</p>
<p>Servants bowed as he passed. Guards saluted. Everyone moving with the practiced efficiency of a well-run machine. His machine.</p>
<p>In the throne room, his advisors waited. Three years of rule had taught them to have reports ready when he arrived.</p>
<p>"The eastern villages sent their tribute early this year," his treasurer said. "Grain, gold, and livestock. All accounted for."</p>
<p>"Good. They're learning." Ixion sat on his throne—carved from a single piece of marble, imported from Athens at significant cost. Worth it. Kings needed thrones that made statements. "What else?"</p>
<p>"The border dispute with Phthia remains unresolved. They're requesting—"</p>
<p>"Let me guess. Arbitration? Negotiation?" Ixion waved his hand dismissively. "Send word: Phthia can submit or prepare for war. I don't have time for diplomatic niceties."</p>
<p>His war captain—a scarred veteran who'd served him since the beginning—grinned. "They'll submit. They always do."</p>
<p>"Because they're smart." Ixion stood. "Anything else requiring immediate attention?"</p>
<p>"The new tax policy has some villages complaining—"</p>
<p>"Then they can pay or relocate. I'm not running a charity." He started toward the stables. "I'm leaving for Olympus within the hour. You know what to do if anything urgent arises."</p>
<p>"Crush it?"</p>
<p>"Exactly."</p>
<p>The ride to Olympus took most of the day. Ixion passed through territories he'd conquered, through lands that flew his colors, through villages that emptied their streets when they saw his approach. Not from hatred—from respect. From knowing their place in the order of things.</p>
<p>Power wasn't about being loved. It was about being inevitable.</p>
<p>By sunset, he reached the mountain. The gates of Olympus gleamed in fading light—gold and bronze and something that looked like captured starlight. Impressive. Even he had to admit that.</p>
<p>Time to see if gods fucked as well as they built.</p>
<hr />
<p>Olympus at sunset looked like everything he'd imagined and more.</p>
<p>Ixion walked through the gates with the confidence of someone who'd never been told no. The other mortal guests—nervous, awed, clutching their invitations like shields—scattered before him. He ignored them. Peasants playing at nobility.</p>
<p>The courtyard was magnificent. Gods everywhere—beautiful, powerful, casual in their divinity. Wine flowing from fountains. Music that seemed to come from the air itself. The kind of excess that came from never having to worry about anything.</p>
<p>He could work with this.</p>
<p>A server approached with wine. Pretty boy, dark curls, looked at him hopefully. Ixion took the cup without acknowledging him. He wasn't here for servants.</p>
<p>Hera stood by the central fountain wearing a dress that was barely decent. Queen of Olympus. Zeus's wife. The most beautiful woman in any pantheon.</p>
<p>Target acquired.</p>
<p>He walked straight toward her. No hesitation. No games.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty."</p>
<p>She turned. Looked him up and down with obvious appreciation. "Ixion of Thessaly. The conqueror."</p>
<p>"You've heard of me."</p>
<p>"Everyone's heard of you. The mortal who unified Thessaly through sheer force of will." She smiled. "Bold. Ambitious. Exactly Zeus's type of mortal."</p>
<p>"I'm not here for Zeus's attention."</p>
<p>"No?" Her hand found his arm. "Then whose attention are you here for?"</p>
<p>"I think you know."</p>
<p>She laughed—genuine, delighted. "I like direct men. Walk with me."</p>
<p>They moved through the crowd. Other gods watching, whispering, smirking. Ixion didn't care. Let them watch. Let them see a mortal take what he wanted.</p>
<p>The gardens were darker, quieter. Private. Hera turned to face him, and for just a moment her form flickered—something not quite solid underneath.</p>
<p>"Before we continue," she said, "you should know—I'm not actually Hera."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Zeus made a copy. Cloud-body. Nephele." She gestured at herself. "To test mortals. See if they'll try to seduce his wife."</p>
<p>Ixion considered this. Looked at her—perfect form, divine beauty, everything he'd come here for.</p>
<p>"Do you want to stop?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Do you?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then does it matter?" She pulled him close. "I'm real enough for this."</p>
<p>What followed was aggressive, enthusiastic, mutual. Cloud-Hera matched him move for move—nails raking his back, teeth on his shoulder, both of them treating it like combat and conquest combined. They barely made it to the grass.</p>
<p>After, they lay catching their breath. Cloud-Hera was already reforming her dress, looking satisfied.</p>
<p>"That was—"</p>
<p>Lightning cracked across the sky.</p>
<p>Zeus appeared with his entire court behind him. Witnesses. Audience. Everyone who'd been waiting for exactly this moment.</p>
<p>Ixion stood, fastening his chiton. Didn't bother looking apologetic.</p>
<p>"How DARE you," Zeus said, voice shaking the trees, "attempt to seduce my WIFE."</p>
<p>Ixion gestured at the cloud-copy. "That's not your wife. It's a test. And we both passed with flying colors."</p>
<p>The assembled gods gasped. Athena stepped forward, face cold with disgust. "Mortals. No shame. No restraint."</p>
<p>"I came to Olympus, saw beauty, and took my chance." Ixion met Zeus's eyes. "Just like you do. Every day. With every mortal that catches your eye."</p>
<p>Zeus's lightning crackled brighter. "You compare yourself to ME?"</p>
<p>"I'm a king. You're a king. The only difference is time." Ixion smiled. "And honestly? Your test was obvious. Maybe make better traps if you want better results."</p>
<p>The court went silent.</p>
<p>Zeus moved closer. "You will learn humility."</p>
<p>"I know what I am." Ixion didn't step back. "Do you?"</p>
<p>Guards appeared. Bronze hands on his arms. Stronger than mortal strength. They dragged him backward, away from Zeus, away from the garden.</p>
<p>Ixion didn't fight. Just laughed.</p>
<p>"Worth it!" he called back. "Completely worth it!"</p>
<p>Zeus's expression went from rage to something colder. More calculating.</p>
<p>"Hephaestus," he said quietly. "The wheel. Make it burn forever."</p>
<p>They dragged Ixion toward the forge.</p>
<p>The last thing he heard was Athena's voice: "Disgusting. Mortals who think they're equal to gods. This is what happens when you give them too much power."</p>
<p>The last thing Ixion thought: I'd do it again. Every time. Without hesitation.</p>
<hr />
<p>The wheel snapped him back to present.</p>
<p>Ixion gasped. The memory released him like jaws opening. Fire burned. Pain lanced through every nerve.</p>
<p>Was that real?</p>
<p>Had he been that? That arrogant? That certain? That proud?</p>
<p>Or had he been the other version? The one in the garden? The one who loved Ganymede?</p>
<p>The wheel spun faster. Another memory surfacing:</p>
<p>This one showed him as a murderer. Pushing Deioneus into the pit of fire, watching him burn, feeling nothing.</p>
<p>Which was real?</p>
<p>All of them felt true. All of them felt false.</p>
<p>The fire burned hotter.</p>
<p>Ixion tried to hold onto something—any memory, any truth, any piece of himself that made sense.</p>
<p>But the wheel kept spinning.</p>
<p>The memories kept fragmenting.</p>
<p>And slowly, rotation by rotation, he was forgetting which one had been real. Which crimes he'd committed. Which man he'd been.</p>
<p>The wheel turned.</p>
<p>The memories scattered.</p>
<p>The truth dissolved into infinite versions—all equally vivid, all equally suspect.</p>
<p>That was the punishment.</p>
<p>Not the fire that burned his flesh.</p>
<p>Not the chains that held him bound.</p>
<p>Not even the eternity of spinning.</p>
<p>The punishment was forgetting himself.</p>
<p>Being forced to experience every possible version of his life—hero, villain, lover, rapist, victim, monster—and never knowing which one had actually happened.</p>
<p>Somewhere above, in Olympus, Zeus sat on his throne.</p>
<p>The system was working perfectly.</p>
<p>Ixion of Thessaly, the man who couldn't remember his own truth, spinning forever in the dark.</p>
<p>Each rotation showing him a different past.</p>
<p>Each memory equally real.</p>
<p>Each truth equally false.</p>
<p>And the fire-</p>
<p>The fire just burned.</p>
