<h1 id="chapter-2-the-weight-of-crowns">Chapter 2: The Weight of Crowns</h1>
<p>Zeus woke with his hands at his own throat.</p>
<p>The dream: always the same. Chronos's jaws opening. His siblings screaming as they disappeared into darkness. Then the shift - his own hands crushing a windpipe. His face in water: his father's face staring back.</p>
<p>He gasped awake, tent canvas pressing down. Poseidon snored in the corner. Zeus silent: can't show breaking. Leaders don't break.</p>
<p>Outside. Cold air, pre-dawn. Camp sleeping.</p>
<p>Distant palace on the ridge: throne visible even from here. Waiting.</p>
<p>His hands shaking. Looked at them in moonlight. His father's hands.</p>
<p>"I am not my father."</p>
<p>Whispered it. Didn't believe it.</p>
<p>Then he saw movement: Metis's tent. Lamplight burning. She was awake too, but working. Not haunted. The contrast struck him like a blow.</p>
<p>Poseidon appeared beside him.</p>
<p>"You were restless." That accusotry edge. The one he reserved for his brother.</p>
<p>Zeus shrugged. What could he say?</p>
<p>"The strategist. Metis. You trust her?"</p>
<p>He remembered: her walking into war council yesterday. "You're not winning this through volume." The way she'd laid her map over theirs. The certainty.</p>
<p>"I trust she sees things we don't." Careful words. The kind he'd practiced for leadership.</p>
<p>Poseidon studied his face. "You're looking at her the way father looked at power."</p>
<p>Zeus's spine stiffened. "I'm nothing like-"</p>
<p>"Not yet." Poseidon's voice flat. "None of us are. Yet."</p>
<p>The word hung between them.</p>
<p>Hades emerged from another tent. Saw them, joined without speaking. He said nothing, but his silence agreed. The quiet brother who'd learned to swallow screaming.</p>
<p>Three brothers who survived. Three who watched Chronos consume the others.</p>
<p>They stood together in silence, then disperced as the dawn broke red. Poseidon first, already turning away. Hades followed moments later, a shadow peeling away.</p>
<p>Zeus alone with the water cup. Hands still shaking. In the distance: Chronos's palace. Closer: Metis's tent.</p>
<hr />
<p>Night had fallen. The day passed in preparation Zeus barely remembered.</p>
<p>He stood in the command tent, staring at Metis's map. The modifications she'd made. The empty spaces where wars were won.</p>
<p>Footsteps. She entered without asking permission.</p>
<p>"You're still awake."</p>
<p>"Studying your strategy."</p>
<p>"Our strategy." Correction automatic. Teacher's instinct. She sat across from him, spread additional maps. Charcoal-stained fingers moving with precision. "Tomorrow's battle is simple. The war after is harder."</p>
<p>She traced routes. Explained timing. Zeus listened, but also watched. The way she bit her lip when thinking. The certainty in how she moved. How she corrected him without hesitation.</p>
<p>"Here." She pointed. "Your instinct will be to pursue when they break. Don't."</p>
<p>"Why not?" A Genuine question. Not challenging - he wanted to understand.</p>
<p>"Because Chronos expects rage. Give him calculation instead." She said it like a law of nature. Like she'd proven it a hundred times before.</p>
<p>They worked through scenarios. Hours passing. Lamp burning low.</p>
<p>"Why did you really come here?" Zeus asked.</p>
<p>She looked up. "I told you. To teach-"</p>
<p>"No. Really." His eyes locked on hers. "You had safe positions. You walked into a losing war to teach angry gods mercy. Why?"</p>
<p>Long pause. Measuring him. Measuring the risk. "Because I can see patterns. And the pattern says you become your father unless someone shows you differently."</p>
<p>The truth hit Zeus like a fist. First his brother, now, this newcomer? He felt something boil inside him: Rage. No. He had to let that go. His next breath was deep.</p>
<p>"What if I already am?" His voice dropped. The question he'd been choking on since he woke.</p>
<p>"Then I wasted a three-week journey." She didn't look away. "But I don't think you are. Not yet."</p>
<p>Zeus reached across the map. Didn't quite touch her hand. "And if I listen? If I learn?"</p>
<p>"Then maybe we stop the cycle. Maybe we build something that doesn't require your children to overthrow you."</p>
<p>She was thinking decades ahead. He could barely see past tomorrow.</p>
<p>"Teach me," he said. Meant it. The first honest thing he'd said all day.</p>
<p>She smiled: small, sad, hopeful. "I already am."</p>
<p>They returned to the maps. But something had shifted. Their shoulders nearly touching as they leaned over the table. Her explaining. Him asking questions, actually wanting answers.</p>
<p>Not the symbol. Not the king. Just Zeus, learning.</p>
<p>Hours later, she stood to leave. "Tomorrow we win. Tomorrow you become king."</p>
<p>His hand moved, unconsciously, toward where a throne would be. Closed around empty air.</p>
<p>"With you," he said. "We do this together."</p>
<p>She studied his face. Something flickered there. Doubt? Fear?</p>
<p>"Together," she agreed.</p>
<p>But the word sounded different in her mouth. Like she was agreeing to something he didn't quite say.</p>
<p>She left.</p>
<p>Zeus was alone with maps and the gesture his hand had just made.</p>
<p>Claiming. Taking. Wanting both.</p>
<hr />
<p>Zeus climbed to the ridge above camp. Couldn't sleep. Both armies visible below: his camp's nervous fires, Chronos's palace lights.</p>
<p>The throne up there. Through distant windows.</p>
<p>Tomorrow decided everything.</p>
<p>Footsteps behind him. Didn't turn.</p>
<p>"Couldn't sleep either?" Metis's voice.</p>
<p>She sat beside him on cold stone. Comfortable silence.</p>
<p>Then, once again broken by Metis: "What will you do with it? When you win?"</p>
<p>"With what?"</p>
<p>"The throne. The power." She gestured at the palace. "What you're fighting for."</p>
<p>He realized: hadn't thought past victory. Just: defeat father, take throne, become king.</p>
<p>"I'll rule differently. With counsel."</p>
<p>"Whose counsel?"</p>
<p>He looked at her. "Yours. If you'll give it."</p>
<p>"And if I refuse?"</p>
<p>The question caught him off-guard. "Why would you?"</p>
<p>"Because power changes people. Because thrones corrupt." She watched him carefully. "Because you might become what you're fighting."</p>
<p>"I'm not him."</p>
<p>"Your father said that too. Once."</p>
<p>The words landed like blows. Zeus stood, pacing. "Then what? I defeat him and walk away? Let someone else rule?"</p>
<p>"I'm not saying that."</p>
<p>"Then what are you saying?"</p>
<p>"I'm saying..." She stood too, facing him. "Be careful what you reach for. Make sure you know why you want it."</p>
<p>Zeus looked at her, really looked.</p>
<p>Saw: the teacher trying to save him.<br />
Saw: the woman he was falling for.<br />
Saw: the wisdom he needed.</p>
<p>But also felt: the hunger. The certainty that throne should be his. The need to claim.</p>
<p>"I want to be different," he said. Meant it.</p>
<p>"I want to build what we talked about." Also true.</p>
<p>"I want-" He stopped.</p>
<p>Couldn't say: I want you.<br />
Couldn't say: I want the throne.<br />
Couldn't admit: I want both, and I'll have both.</p>
<p>She touched his arm. "Tomorrow we win. Then we see who you become."</p>
<p>Started walking back to camp.</p>
<p>Zeus watched her go. Then turned to the palace. The throne visible through windows.</p>
<p>His hand moved again: that unconscious gesture. Reached toward it across the distance. Closed into a fist.</p>
<p>He could have both. The love that made him better. The power that made him king.</p>
<p>With her wisdom, he'd be different.</p>
<p>Wouldn't he?</p>
<p>Thunder rumbled distant. Zeus didn't notice. Too busy imagining tomorrow. Victory. Throne. Her beside it.</p>
<p>His. All of it his.</p>
