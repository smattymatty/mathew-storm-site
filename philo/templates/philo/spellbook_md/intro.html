<h1 id="philosophical-explorations">Philosophical Explorations</h1>
<p>Welcome to my philosophical explorations, where absurdism meets algorithms and humanity grapples with the machines we've built.</p>
<h2 id="current-explorations">Current Explorations</h2>
<h3 id="philosophical-musings-on-modern-absurdism"><a href="/philo/musings/">Philosophical Musings on Modern Absurdism</a></h3>
<p>Exploring Humanist Absurdism, Techno-Absurdism, and Neo-Absurdism through the lens of "The Labyrinth of Sisyphus."</p>
<h2 id="the-three-extensions-of-absurdism">The Three Extensions of Absurdism</h2>
<h3 id="humanist-absurdism"><a href="/philo/humanist-absurdism/">Humanist Absurdism</a></h3>
<p><em>The radical act of choosing compassion in systems designed for cruelty</em></p>
<p>The philosophy of embedding kindness within inhuman systems. When we cannot escape the labyrinth, we can at least ensure it contains windows, gardens, and secret doors. Every line of code is a moral choice.</p>
<h3 id="techno-absurdism"><a href="/philo/techno-absurdism/">Techno-Absurdism</a></h3>
<p><em>We build prisons of logic that learn to perfect themselves</em></p>
<p>The recognition that we've created systems that operate beyond human comprehension while still serving human-defined goals. We are architects of our own incomprehension, debugging processes that debug themselves.</p>
<h3 id="neo-absurdism"><a href="/philo/neo-absurdism/">Neo-Absurdism</a></h3>
<p><em>The boulder was training for building better boulders</em></p>
<p>The philosophy that our punishments evolve to match our capacity to endure them. We don't just push bouldersâ€”we optimize boulder-pushing, gamify it, monetize it, and teach others to do the same. We become complicit in perfecting our own containment.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-questions">The Core Questions</h2>
<p>In an age where machines learn from our data, what must we learn from our compassion?</p>
<p>When algorithms operate beyond human comprehension, who bears responsibility for their outcomes?</p>
<p>If our punishments evolve to match our capacity to endure them, what does liberation look like?</p>
<h2 id="the-philosophy">The Philosophy</h2>
<p>I'm developing <strong>Humanist Absurdism</strong> - a philosophy that accepts life's fundamental absurdity while insisting on the radical act of choosing compassion within systems designed for cruelty.</p>
<p>Through fiction, code, and philosophical inquiry, I explore how we maintain our humanity while building the very systems that constrain us.</p>
<p>Two other sub-fields include:</p>
<p><strong>Techno Absurdism</strong> - The recognition that we've created systems (algorithms, AI, automated processes) that operate beyond human comprehension while still serving human-defined goals.</p>
<p><strong>Neo Absurdism</strong> - The philosophy that we become complicit in perfecting our own containment, building the very systems that constrain us in increasingly sophisticated ways.</p>
<p>These are my three extensions of Albert Camus' original Absurdism.</p>
